<seg id="1"> Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen . </seg>
<seg id="2"> Thank you very much for having me here today . </seg>
<seg id="3"> And now I have to present myself by myself . </seg>
<seg id="4"> My name is Christian Kromberg and I am a councilor , weird word , of the city of Essen . </seg>
<seg id="5"> These are so-called elected public officers for eight years . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And my tasks include : first , personnel , second , organization and third , public order . </seg>
<seg id="7"> Thus , I am responsible for the parking tickets in this city . </seg>
<seg id="8"> And yes , like that you don't become popular . </seg>
<seg id="9"> I know . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Furthermore , and this is something that my son especially likes , I am the head of the fire brigade . </seg>
<seg id="11"> Which means that I am the chief of the fire brigade of Essen . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Seven hundred and fifty professional fire-fighters and five hundred volunteers . </seg>
<seg id="13"> And thereby I thought about one important topic with which I want to confront you today . </seg>
<seg id="14"> It's the topic of disaster control , because also this is part of the fire brigade . </seg>
<seg id="15"> We hope for the best and prepare for the worst , that is what Jack Welch once said . </seg>
<seg id="16"> You know him . </seg>
<seg id="17"> He worked at General Electrics . </seg>
<seg id="18"> And then I start saying something a bit less serious . </seg>
<seg id="19"> I will explain a situation to you . </seg>
<seg id="20"> That is how we call it when there is a risk , when a catastrophe is imminent , for example the main station of Essen , rush hour . </seg>
<seg id="21"> A lot of people are on their way . </seg>
<seg id="22"> It gets crowded and accumulates . </seg>
<seg id="23"> And somewhere at the edge is a suitcase , lonely , abandoned , a bit worn-out , maybe plastered with stickers . </seg>
<seg id="24"> Nobody seems to belong to it . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Nobody owns the suitcase . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Suddenly an announcement . </seg>
<seg id="27"> Please leave the area of the train station . </seg>
<seg id="28"> The police comes , the fire brigade , emergency lights . </seg>
<seg id="29"> People shout . </seg>
<seg id="30"> Officers yell . </seg>
<seg id="31"> Please go out . </seg>
<seg id="32"> What's going on , passer-bys ask . </seg>
<seg id="33"> We don't know or we are not allowed to tell you . </seg>
<seg id="34"> The people leave the building . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Children cry . </seg>
<seg id="36"> Some even fall since everything has to go quickly . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Suddenly a rumor . </seg>
<seg id="38"> It contains poison gas . </seg>
<seg id="39"> Panic breaks out . </seg>
<seg id="40"> I will stop here . </seg>
<seg id="41"> The rest is up to your imagination . </seg>
<seg id="42"> However , it is no phantom of imagination what I told you . </seg>
<seg id="43"> This is exactly what happened this week in DÃ¼sseldorf . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Such a suitcase was left there . </seg>
<seg id="45"> Afterwards , it turned out that there were nothing , in inverted commas , but nine kilograms of drugs inside . </seg>
<seg id="46"> But the people were pushed out of the building in the same way , a friend told me . </seg>
<seg id="47"> They were told nothing . </seg>
<seg id="48"> And exactly this rumor suddenly appeared at least in the group of my friend . </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thankfully no panic broke out otherwise the whole situation wouldn't have ended that harmlessly . </seg>
<seg id="50"> You see that in a crisis situation , in a starting catastrophe , communication is a very important good . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Communication is important because the people in this situation long for communication . </seg>
<seg id="52"> They want to know that is going on . </seg>
<seg id="53"> Earlier in the good old days , it was easier for the authorities . </seg>
<seg id="54"> We just didn't say anything or lied . </seg>
<seg id="55"> Why ? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Because the so-called panic myth prevailed . </seg>
<seg id="57"> One has justified by saying that , oh my Good , the people will panic , so it would be better not to tell the truth or to tell the untruth . </seg>
<seg id="58"> In a time of social media , in a time of Twitter , in a time of Facebook , in a time of private and public broadcasting companies , in a time of private and public television this is not possible any more . </seg>
<seg id="59"> Plain and simple because first , it is not ethical and second , we as an authority are most of the time the last ones who report on the events . </seg>
<seg id="60"> You may remember the plane crash in the Hudson River some years ago . </seg>
<seg id="61"> The first announcement came via Twitter . </seg>
<seg id="62"> From someone who was on a ferry and plain and simple immediately tweeted , a plan had crashed here and we are saving the people now . </seg>
<seg id="63"> This wasn't communication of the authorities . </seg>
<seg id="64"> As you can see we plain and simple need to tell the truth right from the beginning on today and to provide a lot of information . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Because most of the time we are the last ones who are supposed to know the truth , because we as authorities have to check that we do only spread reliable information . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Public media or also private media are either not as bound to this as we are or they just don't do it . </seg>
<seg id="67"> Therefore , we in Essen , and this is something that has already dominated the media , have thought about how to deal with disaster communication in the future . </seg>
<seg id="68"> And therefore , we will get out the good old horn . </seg>
<seg id="69"> However , only as a medium for the first communication . </seg>
<seg id="70"> This means that in the following years , we will install about one hundred horns in the city region which , some of you may still know it , will start blaring in the case of a catastrophe . </seg>
<seg id="71"> In former times that was it . </seg>
<seg id="72"> You know , maybe you remember what the signal three times short , one time short , one time long and one time short means . </seg>
<seg id="73"> I don't know it any more . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Today , we want to combine this with all communication possibilities we have , such as multimedia , via Facebook , via Twitter , via the radio of course and even at night , via television and in general via Internet and the local media and so on and so forth , connected of course with telephone switchboards in order to finally transfer the information . </seg>
<seg id="75"> And we know that we have to act fast and thoroughly and we know that we have to inform fast an thoroughly because otherwise we will irritate the citizens . </seg>
<seg id="76"> And they will finally not believe any more what we want to tell them . </seg>
<seg id="77"> Thus , communication during a crisis in one the one hand a question of rapidity via all media we have and it is a question of trustworthiness . </seg>
<seg id="78"> Trustworthiness is our biggest problem because either the citizens say , well , they are just exaggerating , it is not true , they lie and everything is worse than it is in reality . </seg>
<seg id="79"> We have had a positive experience with Facebook and Twitter , just recently . </seg>
<seg id="80"> You , some of you may have heard of this in the media . </seg>
<seg id="81"> We had a bigger find of a bomb in Essen Kray . </seg>
<seg id="82"> It was a so-called chemical bomb . </seg>
<seg id="83"> These are bombs with a long-term detonator because they should not explode when first bouncing onto the roof of a house , but glide through the houses in the second World War and only on the floor due to a chemical reaction , triggered by a small metal plate separating two acids dissolves and then it came to an explosion . </seg>
<seg id="84"> The problem is now that many pf these bomb never worked and are still lying in the city region as for example in Essen Kray . </seg>
<seg id="85"> And there an older gentleman , who wanted to , as he nicely expressed it in the protocol , ease his conscience , he saw how it came down in nineteen forty-three and now two thousand and thirteen he informed the authorities that there is a bomb . </seg>
<seg id="86"> Anyway , afterwards , many more older gentlemen in the whole city region reported this . </seg>
<seg id="87"> We will see what we will find . </seg>
<seg id="88"> These bomb do not have to be disarmed , but immediately be blown . </seg>
<seg id="89"> Thus , plain and simple we literally blew up a bomb in the Krayer Park . </seg>
<seg id="90"> And for the first time in history of the city , the whole communication happened via Facebook and Twitter with the consequence that the entire blasting operation was followed by a total of far more than sixty thousand followers . </seg>
<seg id="91"> And the media were enthusiastic . </seg>
<seg id="92"> We didn't even have to call them , they just read everything and made notes , everything via Facebook and Twitter . </seg>
<seg id="93"> The whole story had an immense effect for us since the trustworthiness was significantly higher via social media . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Simply because you have to give me a sign when I have to stop . </seg>
<seg id="95"> I cannot see the clock from here . </seg>
<seg id="96"> That is , the trustworthiness because first , these social media have the advantage that they pass on factual information . </seg>
<seg id="97"> They do not so much influence the opinion because the members tweeting there or the followers , as you call them , are highly interested in obtaining information . </seg>
<seg id="98"> Second , quick corrections . </seg>
<seg id="99"> If something is not correct , somebody will immediately write this , like that the trustworthiness I have just mentioned is much higher because the whole community actually participates in the creation of the announcement . </seg>
<seg id="100"> And it is a very high correction speed , so if something is wrong , it can be quickly corrected . </seg>
<seg id="101"> And we have a large spread . </seg>
<seg id="102"> As I said , sixty thousand who found it exciting how a bomb in the Krayer Park explodes . </seg>
<seg id="103"> Thus , we have from all the things that happened in recent years and a lot more disasters happened as anybody thinks or knows of . </seg>
<seg id="104"> Even the city of Essen can become the victim of such a disaster every day . </seg>
<seg id="105"> A bomb which has to be blown is clearly not one of it . </seg>
<seg id="106"> But it can also , and that is what we are digging for , be found in the garden of your neighbor and then we are there with our teaspoons and try to find it seven meters below ground level . </seg>
<seg id="107"> And when they , think of Munich , think of other cities , when they have to be blown because they have such an acid detonator that you cannot disarm in a conventional way , then we already know that many houses will not look the same afterwards . </seg>
<seg id="108"> And it is important to communicate this , on the one hand , because in a world of rapid communication it is necessary to communicate in order to for instance prevent the people from panicking , to take care that the people are informed , to take care that the people are capable to adapt to such a difficult situation . </seg>
<seg id="109"> And the social media also help us to be trustworthy since eventually everybody participates in communication and it does not only come from the side of the authorities as it was the case in the seventies , eighties and certainly to a large extent also in the nineties . </seg>
<seg id="110"> Thus , today , disaster prevention is not only the task of the authorities , it is not only up to the fire brigade or the aid organizations , of the technical emergency service , the Johanniter , the Red Cross et cetera , but communication during a catastrophe and the overcoming of a catastrophe concerns all of us . </seg>
<seg id="111"> And Magdeburg showed that . </seg>
<seg id="112"> There , a greater part of the help took place via Twitter or Facebook , even though we were sometimes a bit overcharged because , suddenly , lots of people wanted to build some dikes and we didn't know any more where the sandbags were . </seg>
<seg id="113"> This shows that there is still a lot to do , also for the public communication in a case of emergency , but the unprecedented solidarity with the citizens of Magdeburg and its surroundings has simply shown that disaster communication is not possible any more without the social media . </seg>
<seg id="114"> And I hope that I have convinced you a bit and that these media , that is often used for the positive things in life , can also be reasonably used during crisis and that we as a city which is responsible for the catastrophe prevention will discover it and expand it in a new way in the future for your , for the benefit of the citizens and I will finish here and say thank you for your attention even when I could hardly see the whole time . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Thank you very much . </seg>

<doc docid="Entertaining" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> So , good evening . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I am Sharlene Anders . </seg>
<seg id="3"> I am a writer and a director , as you just heard . </seg>
<seg id="4"> And on top of that I am starting my own production company right now . </seg>
<seg id="5"> And I'll show you in a moment what it is that I'm going to produce there . </seg>
<seg id="6"> But before I do that , I have to make some remarks . </seg>
<seg id="7"> The first thing is , I believe that we really need stories to survive . </seg>
<seg id="8"> That we couldn't live without stories . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Furthermore I believe that there are many more stories worth reading , hearing , and seeing , than are actually being produced by the entertainment industry . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Moreover I believe that really almost nobody uses the Internet , the infinite vastness , properly in a narrative manner . </seg>
<seg id="11"> And fourthly , I am firmly convinced that humans are made to be creative . </seg>
<seg id="12"> And that they are happier when they are allowed to be creative . </seg>
<seg id="13"> With more people being happy the world is doing better . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Quite logical . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Now this better world is just a by-product , however . </seg>
<seg id="16"> First and foremost I am , as I said , a storyteller . </seg>
<seg id="17"> And the story I would like to tell begins at midnight in a bar , where people are just singing Happy-birthday . </seg>
<seg id="18"> This is Alea . </seg>
<seg id="19"> And it is Alea's twenty-first birthday . </seg>
<seg id="20"> Now she doesn't notice much of the congratulations and the singing , because in the moment it has turned midnight , something happens to her . </seg>
<seg id="21"> Something is happening in her head , in her body , with her perception . </seg>
<seg id="22"> And she doesn't really have the words for it . </seg>
<seg id="23"> She doesn't know what is happening there . </seg>
<seg id="24"> But I do have words for this . </seg>
<seg id="25"> I call this the Wizard-of-Oz-effect . </seg>
<seg id="26"> You see on the one side Dorothy and Toto in Kansas and all is rather black and white . </seg>
<seg id="27"> I've got the feeling somehow my sound is very noisy . </seg>
<seg id="28"> Sorry . </seg>
<seg id="29"> And on the other side we have both of them then in the Land of Oz with plenty of color . </seg>
<seg id="30"> And let me tell you at this point that I stage and write better than I draw . </seg>
<seg id="31"> So , the first thing Alea sees now with her new perception is a strange man with fiery red hair , who stands before her , looks at her seriously and says : congratulations , you life is over . </seg>
<seg id="32"> That's Mikesch . </seg>
<seg id="33"> Mikesch explains to Alea that she belongs to a very special kind of human beings . </seg>
<seg id="34"> She was born a player . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Players are people who , from age twenty-one , have to play for their remaining life span . </seg>
<seg id="36"> How many of you know Highlander ? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Very nice . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Imagine the immortals there wouldn't draw their swords when they meet , but take game accessories out of their pocket . </seg>
<seg id="39"> That is dices , playing cards , spillikins , all sorts of things . </seg>
<seg id="40"> The really important thing is , the players do not see into their playing time . </seg>
<seg id="41"> Just like we don't know when we are going to die . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Of course I wish everybody a long life , but we just don't know . </seg>
<seg id="43"> Tomorrow everything may be over already . </seg>
<seg id="44"> And this applies to my players , too . </seg>
<seg id="45"> They have absolutely no idea just how much they can play for . </seg>
<seg id="46"> Then again this means that every lost minute might have been the last . </seg>
<seg id="47"> A player who has gambled away his whole life span goes out in the moment he loses , just like a candle blown out . </seg>
<seg id="48"> Of course , this raises the question : if it's really that dangerous , then why do they play at all ? </seg>
<seg id="49"> The answer is perfectly obvious : this . </seg>
<seg id="50"> Without playing , without players around you , Kansas , all is gray , and a player is only really alive when he is playing . </seg>
<seg id="51"> They were born to play . </seg>
<seg id="52"> So . </seg>
<seg id="53"> This story about Alea and how she is learning to know the world of the players now , facing the first challenges and , of course , inevitably falling in love with Mikesch , this is the story I would like to tell . </seg>
<seg id="54"> And that in the form of a web series . </seg>
<seg id="55"> The first season contains twelve episodes , sorry , I mixed up the digits here and noticed it too late . </seg>
<seg id="56"> So , twelve episodes in the first season , each of them five to seven minutes long . </seg>
<seg id="57"> You are familiar with this kind of storytelling , one episode after the other , in a nice unidirectional way . </seg>
<seg id="58"> Ever since the moment of its birth TV has done nothing else . </seg>
<seg id="59"> That isn't new . </seg>
<seg id="60"> And if that were all , then for one thing I would be done now . </seg>
<seg id="61"> And , besides , wouldn't be here at all . </seg>
<seg id="62"> But that's just the beginning . </seg>
<seg id="63"> Let's return to Highlander for a moment . </seg>
<seg id="64"> What's the most famous quote from the film or the series ? </seg>
<seg id="65"> There can be only one , right . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Thank you . </seg>
<seg id="67"> As if we had rehearsed it . </seg>
<seg id="68"> And that's exactly what doesn't apply to my players . </seg>
<seg id="69"> There can be plenty of them . </seg>
<seg id="70"> There are so many different games . </seg>
<seg id="71"> Just think of board games , card games , drinking games , strategy games and so on and so forth . </seg>
<seg id="72"> And the number of players is just as uncountable . </seg>
<seg id="73"> And so here are many stories , all waiting to be told . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Now the next question would be : who is supposed to tell them all ? </seg>
<seg id="75"> I do think quite highly of myself . </seg>
<seg id="76"> I think of myself as sufficiently intelligent and extraordinarily creative . </seg>
<seg id="77"> But I know that a hundred brains produce more than a single one , even if it's my one . </seg>
<seg id="78"> So immediately the idea arose to involve the crowd in the creative process . </seg>
<seg id="79"> What if we did not only tolerate or allow fan fiction , but encourage it ? </seg>
<seg id="80"> That is saying , we would like to cordially invite you to develop the plot in the world of this story . </seg>
<seg id="81"> Just image , in episode three , for example , a Mikado player appears , and you really like him because he reminds you , for example , of your grandfather . </seg>
<seg id="82"> Besides you are a big fan of audio plays . </seg>
<seg id="83"> Then you can simply , since it's not that hard anymore with modern technology , make an audio play . </seg>
<seg id="84"> Then you upload it on the platform of the project , where it is , and that's the really cool thing about this , forwarded to the part of the audience that's really interested . </seg>
<seg id="85"> That is to say , it doesn't disappear somewhere , but it lands exactly where it is supposed to land . </seg>
<seg id="86"> The really nice thing about this is that we are on the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="87"> And on the Internet you can really do anything . </seg>
<seg id="88"> That is to say , any medium is allowed somehow . </seg>
<seg id="89"> This means that you as an audience can write , draw , film , whatever you would like to do . </seg>
<seg id="90"> And if we take another look at this structure now . </seg>
<seg id="91"> Somehow this looks like a network , doesn't it ? </seg>
<seg id="92"> Like this story network that is collectively built . </seg>
<seg id="93"> And I am really firmly convinced that the Internet was born to tell exactly these kinds of stories . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Unfortunately there are not many people who do this , or rather nobody does it . </seg>
<seg id="95"> And now I even go a step further and make the spectator himself the player . </seg>
<seg id="96"> Namely in a smartphone game . </seg>
<seg id="97"> There you can compete against characters from the series , but also against people from your real life environment , who also have this game app on their mobile phone . </seg>
<seg id="98"> The buzzwords for this , I'm sure you know them very well , are something like mobile gaming and location based entertainment . </seg>
<seg id="99"> These wonderful fields that are developing rapidly at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="100"> And which I cannot go into or else I would need another twenty minutes . </seg>
<seg id="101"> Let's summarize . </seg>
<seg id="102"> Jeder-ist-mal-dran consists of three parts . </seg>
<seg id="103"> The first part is the web series , the second part is the user generated content , and then we have the smartphone game . </seg>
<seg id="104"> With this project plan I was already able to convince the jury of the , wait , I just have to read it off my notes : the GrÃ¼ndungsinitiative Innovation Duisburg . </seg>
<seg id="105"> They have awarded me the first prize for the best business plan . </seg>
<seg id="106"> And I have to say : this jury was made up of representatives from banks , from the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry , economic development agencies and so on . </seg>
<seg id="107"> So , sensible people , one would think . </seg>
<seg id="108"> And if I can convince them , with my talk about using the Internet right , revolutionize narrative structures , improving the world along the way , then I think I can really convince anybody . </seg>
<seg id="109"> So . </seg>
<seg id="110"> Jeder-ist-mal-dran : why is the whole thing called that ? </seg>
<seg id="111"> Because the name already covers all the fields concerned . </seg>
<seg id="112"> Of course , first we have the playing area : whose turn is it , it's my turn , it's your turn , everyone will get their turn . </seg>
<seg id="113"> Then of course dying . </seg>
<seg id="114"> In the series many , many people die . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Everyone will get their turn means : everyone will have to die one day . </seg>
<seg id="116"> And then of course : everyone will get their turn , meaning everyone can join in if he wants to . </seg>
<seg id="117"> That's very important to me . </seg>
<seg id="118"> I come from theater and there is nothing worse , in my opinion , than when it becomes some kind of participatory theater . </seg>
<seg id="119"> I don't know if you know that . </seg>
<seg id="120"> When you're in the theater and then the actor comes into the auditorium and everyone is like : oh God , please , not me . </seg>
<seg id="121"> And that's exactly what it's not . </seg>
<seg id="122"> So it is a voluntary interaction . </seg>
<seg id="123"> Nobody has to . </seg>
<seg id="124"> He can simply be a spectator . </seg>
<seg id="125"> The reason why I speak German is that the whole project will be in German , for the time being . </seg>
<seg id="126"> This has several reasons . </seg>
<seg id="127"> I've been taking this project around for a while now and I've been asked many times : why don't you do the whole thing in English , larger target audience , blah blah blah . </seg>
<seg id="128"> To this I can only reply : the German book market is the third largest of the world . </seg>
<seg id="129"> The largest is the English , followed by the Spanish and then the German . </seg>
<seg id="130"> So it's not like we are in some small niche . </seg>
<seg id="131"> Besides I really , really , really believe , if there are people who are like me , that these people will be grateful for something that has not been passed through some mills of synchronization , causing each pun and each play on words to disappear . </seg>
<seg id="132"> If everything works as I would like it to , then the first episode will go online on December the first two-thousand-thirteen . </seg>
<seg id="133"> And now if you wonder why I am here now at a TEDx event when it goes under the title ideas worth spreading . </seg>
<seg id="134"> I have thought about that , too . </seg>
<seg id="135"> I love TED talks . </seg>
<seg id="136"> Not only TED talks . </seg>
<seg id="137"> I'm also quite addicted to success guides and self-help books . </seg>
<seg id="138"> There were also some business guidebooks and business plan guidebooks . </seg>
<seg id="139"> And I can really just say that all that knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly inspiring . </seg>
<seg id="140"> But there is no use to it if you don't apply it . </seg>
<seg id="141"> And my project simply is something where I just took everything I have learned . </seg>
<seg id="142"> And applied it . </seg>
<seg id="143"> And it works well so far . </seg>
<seg id="144"> I can really say that . </seg>
<seg id="145"> So , if somebody thinks now : I absolutely want to contribute already , I just had an idea for a character or I've got a drawing or a cartoon or whatever , that's already possible at this stage . </seg>
<seg id="146"> You can already find us on the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="147"> On Facebok . </seg>

<doc docid="Erinnerungen" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> I like how the speakers talk off-the-cuff . </seg>
<seg id="2"> Yes , me , too . </seg>
<seg id="3"> Welcome to : is it possible to erase memories ? </seg>
<seg id="4"> I'm asking you . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Is it possible to erase memories ? </seg>
<seg id="6"> Can you remember everything that has ever happened in your life ? </seg>
<seg id="7"> Have you never forgotten anything ? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Who can remember everything ? </seg>
<seg id="9"> There are no hands raised . </seg>
<seg id="10"> So , is it possible to erase memories ? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Yes , apparently . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Thank you very much . </seg>
<seg id="13"> No , we don't want to make it that easy on ourselves today . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because then the talk would be quite brief . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Good evening again , my name is Samuel Brodbeck . </seg>
<seg id="16"> I chose this talk tonight because it combines two of my passions or my two great passions at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="17"> I have studied computer science not far from here and happened to deal with bits and bytes , which fly around the world in great numbers nowadays . </seg>
<seg id="18"> And I have been working as a coach or a consultant in the private and professional field for quite some time now . </seg>
<seg id="19"> So on the one hand I have dealt with computers a lot , on the other hand I am currently doing a little research on the human components , that is , how does the human nature actually work ? </seg>
<seg id="20"> How can that be changed ? </seg>
<seg id="21"> The let me illustrate an analogy . </seg>
<seg id="22"> Just recently I took part in a very interesting discussion on artificial intelligence . </seg>
<seg id="23"> So , the question was : when will we be able to build a computer that works like the human brain ? </seg>
<seg id="24"> Well , and I think we have come quite close to that . </seg>
<seg id="25"> I think two , three hundred years , it won't take any longer than that . </seg>
<seg id="26"> But let me explain why this might still take some time after all . </seg>
<seg id="27"> The comparison between the computer on the one hand and our brain on the other hand . </seg>
<seg id="28"> If we consider the computer , for example , then everything , that is your smartphone , your tablet , your desktop PC , and also those cameras , and all intelligent refrigerators , is somehow based on such a little chip . </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is called CPU , central processing unit . </seg>
<seg id="30"> These components consist of tiny transistors . </seg>
<seg id="31"> Surely everyone has already heard of this word , and in circuit diagrams it is always depicted as a triangle . </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is a small component that has three terminals and respectively switches electric current or not . </seg>
<seg id="33"> In our CPU we have , I looked it up , about five hundred million of those little components . </seg>
<seg id="34"> And they are wildly switching around there . </seg>
<seg id="35"> We save things , we compute things , we have just heard Albert Einstein say , yeah , a computer can do anything , can do very much , very fast , but in fact all he can do is compare zero and one . </seg>
<seg id="36"> That's all it can do . </seg>
<seg id="37"> In fact it is quite dumb . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Let's compare it to our brain . </seg>
<seg id="39"> The smallest unit in our brain is the neuron , the nerve cell , and we have , I looked this up , too , a hundred billion of them , so there are a hundred billion neurons up here in our gray matter . </seg>
<seg id="40"> The nice thing is , though , our neurons do not only have three terminals , but they have up to twenty thousand per neuron . </seg>
<seg id="41"> And , just because it's so much fun , thus the number of terminals in total amounts to ten trillion . </seg>
<seg id="42"> That's ten with fourteen zeros . </seg>
<seg id="43"> So this shows that the complexity of our brain is already a lot higher than that of the computers we have at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="44"> If we compare the power consumption , maybe some of you know this , the first supercomputers , they had their own power station next door , the mainframes , and the waste heat of the cabinets was used to heat the campus nearby . </seg>
<seg id="45"> Sometimes our heads are spinning , too , but the processor up here needs approximately twenty watt . </seg>
<seg id="46"> And that's the equivalent of two large bananas , that's all you need , and your computer up there works perfectly . </seg>
<seg id="47"> Now if we carry around with us such a great thing up here , such a great computer , then why don't we use it , why do we forget things ? </seg>
<seg id="48"> Maybe some of you know these advertisements on the Internet , like : the human only uses ten per cent of his brain , buy now this DVD set to become a mega brain . </seg>
<seg id="49"> And I think the advertisement is a little mistaken there . </seg>
<seg id="50"> Ten per cent , yes , maybe , but in the course of evolution our brain has grown to this size , it was smaller at some point , in the very middle there is still our reptilian brain , everything else has formed around it . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Surely that didn't happen because we don't use it . </seg>
<seg id="52"> But then why does it seem like the greatest part of it remains unused ? </seg>
<seg id="53"> Perhaps you know the concept of the unconscious ? </seg>
<seg id="54"> I always compare this to an iceberg , if you look at the iceberg , in the ocean , then on top there is the tip , then the water surface , below there is a large chunk . </seg>
<seg id="55"> And these ten per cent on top , that's more or less our logical , our thinking mind , but in the background there is ninety per cent , there is a great unconscious part . </seg>
<seg id="56"> We just heard the statement , we're very slow but we're creative . </seg>
<seg id="57"> And , to return to this talk about memories , perhaps some of you know people with a photographic memory . </seg>
<seg id="58"> People who suddenly remember many more details than I have seen in a situation , you know , and then suddenly they tell you something , I said , yes , of course , but how do you know that ? </seg>
<seg id="59"> There is a special person , a so called savant , somebody with a so called island of genius , generally somebody who is brilliant in one field , who stands out , this person has such a good photographic memory , he was flown in an airplane , no , nonesense , not in an airplane , in a helicopter , he's not that fast after all , over Rome , looked at Rome , and well , Rome is not the smallest city after all , afterwards sat down in front of a giant sheet of drawing paper and started to draw Rome . </seg>
<seg id="60"> And not just somehow , here the river , and there is that , no , every single house , every single door , he looked at every single window once , memorized it , and was able to reproduce it on paper . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Now where does that come from ? </seg>
<seg id="62"> So why can he do that , why can't we do that , perhaps one could assume that person has a little more access to his other ninety per cent . </seg>
<seg id="63"> Now we do use them , but why can't I remember all the details of the menu last night ? </seg>
<seg id="64"> A friend of mine who is a hypnotist has had interesting experiences with this . </seg>
<seg id="65"> For example , he was working in criminal prosecution once and dealt with a rape victim who had completely repressed her experience , it was not present anymore , that was a protective function of the brain , that did not happen , that's gone . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Great , she could perfectly cope with that . </seg>
<seg id="67"> But now it was about arresting these people . </seg>
<seg id="68"> He was able to lead her back to the end or the moment after this incident in a very safe session , even if she wasn't able to remember it actively , she was then able to recognize the license plate of the car in which these people drove off , it wasn't parked nearby , it was fifty meters away . </seg>
<seg id="69"> And in fact , this registration number helped catch one of the culprits . </seg>
<seg id="70"> The second case I really liked was when he was hypnotizing a lady , who told him that her mother always used to read Alice in Wonderland to her when she was little , around age four . </seg>
<seg id="71"> She was sitting on her mother's lap then and her mother was reading . </seg>
<seg id="72"> And then he said to her , in trance , read it to me . </seg>
<seg id="73"> And she started reading it out , she was four when that happened , she couldn't read then , today she can . </seg>
<seg id="74"> And then he said , tell me the number of the page . </seg>
<seg id="75"> They really found a copy of Alice in Wonderland in which the text the lady had read out was on exactly that page . </seg>
<seg id="76"> So the brain had memorized the page as it was , as a picture . </seg>
<seg id="77"> After that , she was able to read it out . </seg>
<seg id="78"> So , yes , we really have access to it , but in our everyday life it seems like we have , say , some kind of protective function in order not to overcharge us . </seg>
<seg id="79"> However , now we don't memorize the event itself , but as we just said , he saw a picture there , the page of a book , so in fact what we memorize are sensory impressions , that is , what we see , what we smell , what we hear , what we taste , and what we feel , so if you all think of a yellow lemon now and how you take a hearty bite in it , then you already have an impression of what it tastes like , very popular example . </seg>
<seg id="80"> And , since it's been quite a long evening now , make yourself comfortable in your seats , feet a little erect , and then may I ask you to just close your eyes for a bit . </seg>
<seg id="81"> And think of a very pleasant , positive event in the recent past , yes . </seg>
<seg id="82"> Pick the first that comes to you . </seg>
<seg id="83"> And when you do that now , you may notice that this memory comes with a visual part . </seg>
<seg id="84"> Perhaps you get a picture , maybe even a film ? </seg>
<seg id="85"> Some people don't even notice , because it comes so normally to us , but you do it consciously for the first time . </seg>
<seg id="86"> And when you see that , you may either be in a film , relive everything through your eyes , or how you see yourself on a screen . </seg>
<seg id="87"> The first is called associative , the other dissociative . </seg>
<seg id="88"> Thank you , you may let go of the thoughts , you may open your eyes again . </seg>
<seg id="89"> Who of you has had visual information , hands up ? </seg>
<seg id="90"> Yes , there are a few hands raised , that's how it is , about a third , I'd say , yes , that's about what I expected , it's really something we do so often that in the first moments we don't even notice . </seg>
<seg id="91"> Okay , let's continue . </seg>
<seg id="92"> One thing that's also nice about memories , if you trigger memories , it's not only that memory that surfaces , but the corresponding feeling , we just had a positive event and I have seen some of you smile , that was like , yes , that was nice , there were nice yes , you laugh , and perhaps the memory is still there , in fact with our memories we also record nice feelings or other feelings . </seg>
<seg id="93"> And now there's something exciting . </seg>
<seg id="94"> All that we just talked about was , well , the at this point our brain doesn't make a difference between what we have really remembered and what we just imagine , what we picture . </seg>
<seg id="95"> This is also something you can try at home when you just sit down and imagine something in the future , that hasn't happened yet , you will get similar information like something , when you remember something that lies in the past . </seg>
<seg id="96"> And I'm sure you know these stories one tells in a convivial round , of the old days . </seg>
<seg id="97"> Back then , hey , that and that happened , and that was so nice , and the further the stories date back , the more beautiful the stories are likely to get , hey , at that time people were much more drunk , the evening was much more convivial then , sunsets was much more romantic then , the waterfall was much higher then . </seg>
<seg id="98"> And , I'm asking you , if we do that in retrospect , meaning if we really change our memories , why don't we do it actively ? </seg>
<seg id="99"> I have when I came here , my uncle showed me a picture of his cabin in Switzerland . </seg>
<seg id="100"> A very nice picture , and it's a very nice cabin . </seg>
<seg id="101"> But the picture is even a little nicer than the cabin , so it's artistic freedom , he explained to me , the cabin is turned there a little , there is a little more grass in front of it , there is a beautiful dog lying in front of it , the sun is shining onto the Alps there , it is a picture of that cabin , indeed , that cannot be denied . </seg>
<seg id="102"> And why don't we do that with our own thoughts then , our own memories , hey , why should it bother me if I make what I'm thinking about there even more beautiful ? </seg>
<seg id="103"> Indeed you have artistic freedom in your own thoughts . </seg>
<seg id="104"> Perhaps you know some people , who , when you see them in the morning , just have such gray eyes , what's wrong ? </seg>
<seg id="105"> Well , I didn't sleep well , there was something going through my head all night . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Really , all night , and I didn't get this thought out of my head . </seg>
<seg id="107"> I think it's the other way round , it was he who didn't let go of the thought . </seg>
<seg id="108"> The son of a friend of mine was a little depressed when he came to Germany , because his mother stayed in Hongkong and he just terribly missed her . </seg>
<seg id="109"> What the father did , well , he sat down with his son every night and said , or asked , so , what was the nicest thing that happened today ? </seg>
<seg id="110"> What was the nicest thing , tell me , and then he made him tell , made him embellish it , made him detail the nice thing that happened today . </seg>
<seg id="111"> And within two weeks the son felt great . </seg>
<seg id="112"> And then it was okay , that mommy was gone , she will come to visit after all . </seg>
<seg id="113"> He did that with him throughout his whole youth , and today he's one of the most positive people I know . </seg>
<seg id="114"> So it's not the memories that influence the way we are , but it is our focus on them , our focus on which thoughts we use . </seg>
<seg id="115"> And how much energy we waste or use on that . </seg>
<seg id="116"> So if some evening you get stuck with a thought or say , today that was , that's so , no , I really don't need that , then why not do it like , maybe you know this , Tom Cruise in that science fiction movie , where he has this holographic computer he takes his data from and works on it , why don't you do that , too , pick out your picture that you just have of this , well , not so great , actually you say , yeah , okay , that happened today , but zap , get rid of it . </seg>
<seg id="117"> What else do we have today , ah , something nice , well , look there , oh , I really liked that today , man , that was nice , right ? </seg>
<seg id="118"> And take that with you then . </seg>
<seg id="119"> Integrate that in your unconscious and have it contribute in the background . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Or if someone in authority is mean to you , you know , be it your boss , or your wife , or your husband , sorry , try and laugh about it . </seg>
<seg id="121"> In this case , too , take the picture , and put a funny hat on that person's head . </seg>
<seg id="122"> One of those fools caps with pompoms , have horses jump around in the background , yes , you laugh , why do you laugh ? </seg>
<seg id="123"> Because you are picturing it right now , because thoughts like that are funny . </seg>
<seg id="124"> And suddenly you can deal with the situation much better . </seg>
<seg id="125"> So , is it possible to erase memories ? </seg>
<seg id="126"> No , I believe our brain has so much capacity that it can memorize everything . </seg>
<seg id="127"> That's no problem , however , because we are free to choose how much emphasis we put on or how much importance we attach to an event , a memory , a thought , that depends on us . </seg>
<seg id="128"> And my appeal to you , play with the pictures in your head , use the power of your unconscious and give it suggestions every day that enrich your life . </seg>

<doc docid="Festival" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> Well , good afternoon . </seg>
<seg id="2"> Thank you very much for the invitation . </seg>
<seg id="3"> When someone asks me at a party what I do in in my free time , and I tell them that , together with friends , I organize a music festival , then I see sparkling eyes and in the heads of my listeners the association of dancing crowds of people , portable toilets , tent cities and mud fighting appear . </seg>
<seg id="4"> When I then continue that the festival I am speaking of is a festival for classical music , the pictures of the dancing crowds of people disappear , making room for pictures of old people that are seated in straight , long seating rows in rooms with wood paneling and concentrate on the art . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Frank Zappa once said , talking about music is like dancing about architecture . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And this is almost the same with what we are doing . </seg>
<seg id="7"> However , to give you an impression about what I am going to talk about in a minute , I brought a short film . </seg>
<seg id="8"> Film </seg>
<seg id="9"> There is something rock'n'roll about it . </seg>
<seg id="10"> That is what it expresses it the best in my opinion . </seg>
<seg id="11"> Since two thousand and nine , the podium festival growths because the people enjoy doing something completely different . </seg>
<seg id="12"> We , as organizers , are today between eighteen and mid-twenties or at the end of twenty and have experienced very early in our childhood what incredible power and joy classical music can evoke . </seg>
<seg id="13"> But we have also experienced that the conventions of a cultural business and the market for classical music sometimes can , well , spoil the joy a bit . </seg>
<seg id="14"> And we are firmly convinced that the so-called crisis of the classical music is not a problem of the contents , this means of the music itself , but rather of its form of representation . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Hence , we wonder how to create a concert that gives back to the music the closeness , the joy and power that we love . </seg>
<seg id="16"> How can we organize a festival for classical music that goes beyond the conventions of the cultural business ? </seg>
<seg id="17"> We start by querying the parameters that you all know from classical concerts , such as space , time , light and context . </seg>
<seg id="18"> Let's take the example of the relationship between the audience and the musicians . </seg>
<seg id="19"> Normally , there is a gap between the stage and the audience . </seg>
<seg id="20"> We try to remove it . </seg>
<seg id="21"> Here you see a picture of our Jam concerts . </seg>
<seg id="22"> The musicians are among the audience , they drink beer , during pauses they speak with the audience , get up , play one , two tracks and sit down again among the audience . </seg>
<seg id="23"> The whole thing becomes more relaxed in the course of the evening . </seg>
<seg id="24"> Everyone who likes to participate goes onto the stage and comes back . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Or the sitting in the concert . </seg>
<seg id="26"> In a classical concert it is that you are seated on more or less comfortable , hard chairs , similar to them here , and look in front of you and listen . </seg>
<seg id="27"> However , there is music to which you cannot sit still . </seg>
<seg id="28"> And we thought about how to implement this . </seg>
<seg id="29"> When you sit differently and you can move to rhythmical music , then you listen differently . </seg>
<seg id="30"> Furthermore , we didn't have only one stage , but four , installed around the audience . </seg>
<seg id="31"> The audience could turn with the music . </seg>
<seg id="32"> Like that everyone had the possibility to sit one time during the evening in the first row . </seg>
<seg id="33"> It was important for us that we do not organize no matter what event , but that we consider the music as the most important . </seg>
<seg id="34"> That we ask ourselves which spaces and atmosphere around , but also in the heads of the people , music needs in order to have the effect it should have ? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Like that concerts arise in the middle of the night at ten pm in churches that are actually only illuminated by candles , in clubs , on industrial wasteland , in old wine cellars . </seg>
<seg id="36"> However , it is not only the rooms around and the lightening that can make music vivid and recent but also the combination with other types of art . </seg>
<seg id="37"> And like that we are very happy that , for some years now , we are working together with the national youth ballet who helps us to create dances or movements to chamber music which was not written to dance to . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Like that choreographies to string quartets of Beethoven or to chamber music of Steve Reich develop . </seg>
<seg id="39"> And this year , we fulfilled a childhood dream , if you want to call it like that . </seg>
<seg id="40"> For the first time , we realized a concert together with a team of an animated film . </seg>
<seg id="41"> We managed to create an artistic synthesis of the soldier's tale by Igor Strawinsky with actors , dancers , live music and an animated film . </seg>
<seg id="42"> This worked especially well as we had a big community on the Internet that supported us to create this play . </seg>
<seg id="43"> A crowd funding campaign helped us to collect a lot of money from people everywhere in Germany in order to realize this . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Anyway , this festival is something that is developed by a community . </seg>
<seg id="45"> We are very happy that we found a home in the small town of Esslingen next to Stuttgart . </seg>
<seg id="46"> The town has the perfect size , it is big enough to find great rooms and interesting places for concerts , but also small enough to attract attention . </seg>
<seg id="47"> When at the beginning of the year , during springtime , forty great musicians from everywhere in Europe come to town , the people will remark that there are more people with instrument cases in the streets than normally . </seg>
<seg id="48"> The whole festival is organized by volunteers . </seg>
<seg id="49"> We are a mixture of pupils , students , doctors , literary scholars , music and media technicians , so totally mixed . </seg>
<seg id="50"> And around a leading team of three people that keeps an eye on the overall organization or coordination and the financing , seven to ten active people who commit for one year to undertake functions , form the core team . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Admittedly, also voluntarily , but they take care for one year that there is someone who sees , for instance , for the ticketing or the assistance of the artists and the event technology and that everything is organized until the festival begins . </seg>
<seg id="52"> We are all working in our free time and we live everywhere in Germany . </seg>
<seg id="53"> This means that most of the work is done in a decentralized way and on an Internet platform . </seg>
<seg id="54"> We only meet three times a year for a long weekend , we brainstorm , discuss the one or the other problem that appeared and we also take care of our interpersonal relationships which is extremely important when something like this should work . </seg>
<seg id="55"> At the festival itself , there are twenty to thirty additional volunteers that bring along their hands for some days or weeks and help where help is needed , when carrying chairs , when decorating rooms , when selling tickets , when coating sandwiches . </seg>
<seg id="56"> And of course , the musicians are there for these fifteen days . </seg>
<seg id="57"> You'd almost think that now there is everything that is needed for a festival like that . </seg>
<seg id="58"> But we go farther . </seg>
<seg id="59"> Because we have built a big community around us in Esslingen that supports us in what we we want to do . </seg>
<seg id="60"> This starts with classical sponsoring and goes over to practical things like , for instance , catering , there we have a baker who delivers bread to us or a organic food store that provides fresh groceries . </seg>
<seg id="61"> The whole year round , the ticketing is done and the tickets are sold by a book store in town . </seg>
<seg id="62"> Up to possibilities for practice . </seg>
<seg id="63"> We found a great deal of private individuals in Esslingen who leave us their living rooms in order that the musicians may practice there . </seg>
<seg id="64"> And like that the festival became something special in this town and of the people in this town . </seg>
<seg id="65"> They identify in a special way with the festival . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since the beginning of the year and due to the great help of the local citizens , we were able to bring into being a citizens' foundation that serves as a structure and a safeguard for the whole undertaking and its future . </seg>
<seg id="67"> We as the workforce of Podium believe that classical music rocks , provided that it is placed into the right hands . </seg>
<seg id="68"> Therefore , we are extremely happy that young musicians in whole Europe take the lead and organize Podium festivals at their home towns . </seg>
<seg id="69"> Well , if you still cannot really imagine how it feels to experience classical music in that way , just come by . </seg>
<seg id="70"> At the beginning of the next year , we will be in Esslingen and we would be happy to see you there . </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="Kunst" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> Yes, ladies and gentlemen , learning . </seg>
<seg id="2"> You might think that means acquiring knowledge . </seg>
<seg id="3"> Knowledge is a part of learning or a consequence of learning , but I think learning is so much more , for example gathering experience and gaining power of judgment . </seg>
<seg id="4"> Knowledge times experience times power of judgment , a nice formula for shaping one's life . </seg>
<seg id="5"> What I've learned from art and culture , well , there is so much to tell , given that in the meantime , I've been working in that field . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And that's why I thought it might be good to add another aspect to this rather ambiguous title which shall run through my presentation . </seg>
<seg id="7"> Art is beautiful , yet it requires a lot of work . </seg>
<seg id="8"> You had to laugh , too . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Somebody always laughs , though most people know this saying . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Why do people laugh ? </seg>
<seg id="11"> I think this is down to the fact that the word beautiful contains something that we are not able to understand . </seg>
<seg id="12"> We sometimes say that art is fascinating . </seg>
<seg id="13"> We wouldn't actually refer to work as being fascinating . </seg>
<seg id="14"> Sometimes even . </seg>
<seg id="15"> People who like to work are fascinating for me . </seg>
<seg id="16"> But when it comes to work , we would rather think of daily life whereas art is an area beyond daily life in which we plunge into , gather experience , develop our own thoughts . </seg>
<seg id="17"> And now I'd like to present to you my personal path , in three hours I divided this presentation up into five chapters , each chapter title starting with the letter I , so that it's totally simple for you . </seg>
<seg id="18"> It starts with Invention which stands for childhood , it goes on with Inspiration which stands for my youth , I won't tell you everything , don't worry , it goes on with Initiation , later I'll tell you why I chose this word for the start of my professional career . </seg>
<seg id="19"> Next is Interaction for the first part of my professional life and finally , the fifth chapter will be Identification . </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of you might know these pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach . </seg>
<seg id="21"> Inventions , for two and three voices . </seg>
<seg id="22"> You learn those in the first two , three years , assuming you practice reasonably , which I did . </seg>
<seg id="23"> And at the age of ten , eleven years , I played these minor pieces on the piano , not far from here at the Kreuzeskirche , at home . </seg>
<seg id="24"> These pieces are characterized by their counterpoint . </seg>
<seg id="25"> While a melody is playing , there is a corresponding voice , yet it is totally different . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rhythm is the same , yet the two voices contrast each other . </seg>
<seg id="27"> And this , ladies and gentlemen, is a crucial aspect of art , to be able to combine opposing elements even if it's just two voices , to think coherently , whether it's the present , the future , sometimes the past , in works of art , pictures , choreographies , theater plays , combining things that take place at different points in time , this is what art is about . </seg>
<seg id="28"> And I've learned to play two melodies at the same time , sometimes even three , with the inventions for three voices , to hear each melody , to emphasize one of them and not the other . </seg>
<seg id="29"> Amongst other things , this is what I've learned . </seg>
<seg id="30"> I've never forgotten another incident and I was a bit worried that maybe today , the same would happen again . </seg>
<seg id="31"> I played a piano concert , there were more people in the audience than here today and right in the middle of a Beethoven sonata , I struggled . </seg>
<seg id="32"> I had forgotten the notes . </seg>
<seg id="33"> I played it by heart . </seg>
<seg id="34"> So I started again and at the same point , I still didn't know how to go on . </seg>
<seg id="35"> The audience was sweating almost more than I was because unhurriedly , I went back to my seat , grabbed my notes , laid them down and started again for the third time . </seg>
<seg id="36"> You wouldn't believe the thundering applause I received afterwards . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Still, that was a tough experience . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Maybe it was one of the experiences helping me to realize that , though I quickly got a student card afterwards , maybe I shouldn't become a professional piano player , for it's easier to cheat as a speaker . </seg>
<seg id="39"> Yes , the next chapter of my youth is entitled Inspiration and I'd like to tell you some stories about that , too . </seg>
<seg id="40"> When I was sixteen , I went to my piano teacher and I told him , dear Mr Jure , I'd like to play a waltz by Chopin . </seg>
<seg id="41"> And he said , Oliver , that's not possible . </seg>
<seg id="42"> You would have to had visited a lot of coffee houses and gained considerable experience with the ladies . </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now imagine that , telling that a boy at the tender age of sixteen . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Of course , I've not forgotten it . </seg>
<seg id="45"> From this point , I practiced even more . </seg>
<seg id="46"> By the way , meanwhile I've been to a coffee house a couple of times . </seg>
<seg id="47"> I practiced and I recall one situation that , since then , I've never again experienced . </seg>
<seg id="48"> It was the Scherzo in B minor by Chopin and now I turn to the aspect of work , there was one part I simply didn't master and it was one of the most beautiful parts , you really had to spread your arms , go back to your normal position and spread your arms again . </seg>
<seg id="49"> Unfortunately , I cannot play it now , there is no piano here and I wouldn't be able to anymore . </seg>
<seg id="50"> I played this part twenty , thirty times consecutively and suddenly , I got it . </seg>
<seg id="51"> And then I continued to play and play and play , I went into ecstasies , the only thing I recall is that suddenly , I threw myself on the floor and laughed . </seg>
<seg id="52"> I was delirious . </seg>
<seg id="53"> I hadn't drunk , I hadn't taken drugs , the music had driven me to that point . </seg>
<seg id="54"> Through this experience , I learned to actually accept emotions . </seg>
<seg id="55"> And sometimes , it's the right thing to do , to work so that you fall into such a trance, into this condition which I'd like to call flow . </seg>
<seg id="56"> When everything runs by itself . </seg>
<seg id="57"> We actually had this situation in an organization at the capital of culture in two thousand and ten . </seg>
<seg id="58"> And there , everything went almost by itself , when we were organizing the final event , it took us only two and a half months while usually it would take you one and a half years . </seg>
<seg id="59"> Well , so much for my piano stories , yes , for my artistic work . </seg>
<seg id="60"> Now I'd like to turn to my studies , to Initiation . </seg>
<seg id="61"> At first , I was a musician , yet this was merely a hobby . </seg>
<seg id="62"> We played as a quartet , pipe quartet , piano quartet . </seg>
<seg id="63"> I gave piano lessons and in this way , I was still able to keep up my enthusiasm for music and enjoy being part of a community besides my law studies . </seg>
<seg id="64"> Singing in the choir , breathing together , singing a mass in H minor , wonderful events which were an enriching experience for me . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Then I arrived at a point where I got to the Grillo theater in Essen as a law student , in dramaturgy and administration , and I entitled this chapter Initiation because this idea , this thought came to my mind , to make a profession out of that combination art , culture , politics and law , at that time , in nineteen eighty , I had just become a member of the Social Democratic Party anyhow . </seg>
<seg id="66"> I wanted to succeed in enabling culture , to make it my leitmotif . </seg>
<seg id="67"> Thus , I wanted to commit myself to art , not as an artist , otherwise you wouldn't say art worker , but to continue and make progress as a cultural worker . </seg>
<seg id="68"> I was at the theater and I made inquiries , in Germany , cultural management studies did not exist yet , only in Vienna , so I went there and from then on , I increasingly dealt with that one question , what could you do to enable art , to improve conditions for art , to lay the foundations for good management , good administration ? </seg>
<seg id="69"> And that was the reason I advanced in my professional life , towards this profession , and so I assumed a leading position in cultural affairs at the age of thirty five . </seg>
<seg id="70"> Still , my professional life started off differently , I entitled this chapter Interaction . </seg>
<seg id="71"> In nineteen eighty six , I got to the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag . </seg>
<seg id="72"> The Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag has its office in Cologne . </seg>
<seg id="73"> I'm from the Ruhr Area , though sometimes in my CV it says , Oliver Scheytt from Cologne , because I was born in Cologne , this upsets me , I need to change that . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Still , I have Rhineland roots because my grandparents on my mother's side were originally from Cologne and in Cologne , I celebrated carnival . </seg>
<seg id="75"> I hadn't enjoyed it that much before and suddenly , I was drawn into a different type of culture , a popular culture , a culture that was lived by people in this bureaucratic structure of the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag . </seg>
<seg id="76"> As soon as carnival approached , we found ourselves in a totally different situation , in totally different conditions . </seg>
<seg id="77"> And with my colleague and friend Jochen Dieckmann , who would later become the Minister of Finance and Justice in North Rhine-Westphalia , I played music at the Cologne night , he played the guitar , I played the piano , a third played the bass , at that time , I could play the famous carnival song Alles-hat-ein-Ende-und-nur-die-Wurst-hat-zwei by heart , amongst others . </seg>
<seg id="78"> We played songs from the Wildecker Herzbuben , well , of course we adapted the lyrics to match the Deutscher StÃ¤dtetag , we practiced for months . </seg>
<seg id="79"> And it was actually the people who embodied carnival . </seg>
<seg id="80"> It was my fate that on the ninth of November nineteen eighty nine , I was studying for my doctoral examination and didn't notice the fall of the Berlin wall . </seg>
<seg id="81"> I woke up the next day , I had my oral exam , oh, the wall is down , right . </seg>
<seg id="82"> In a hurry , I prepared myself to answer any questions concerning the Basic Law . </seg>
<seg id="83"> And from then on , I was the representative of cities in the GDR . </seg>
<seg id="84"> And again , I saw interactions taking place between two German cultures . </seg>
<seg id="85"> In fact , we speak the same language , music is played equally wonderfully there , now and in the past , but a lot of things were revalued , reinterpreted . </seg>
<seg id="86"> Different from carnival , this was largely initiated by the state and not just the people , and I perceived it as a source of great enrichment to experience how German identity slowly forced its way and how the German unification treaty brought together these two states , I will come back to that later . </seg>
<seg id="87"> Since then , Germany has been called a cultural state . </seg>
<seg id="88"> Since then , culture has increasingly been promoted on a federal level , too . </seg>
<seg id="89"> But it was in the city of Essen that I learned and experienced interaction first and foremost . </seg>
<seg id="90"> From the beginning on , we had the cultural by the way , I had a business card at that time , imagine that , when I started to work here in nineteen ninety three , on my business card it said Head of the Culture and Leisure Department . </seg>
<seg id="91"> I still have it . </seg>
<seg id="92"> Leisure stood for the Grugapark , it shouldn't say Head of the Culture and Grugapark Department . </seg>
<seg id="93"> Actually , I was the first head of Grugapark . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Leisure is something I haven't right , in any case it was wonderful to have this business card , though it was gone rather soon , because then I got in charge of education and therefore was able to establish and shape connections to the education sector . </seg>
<seg id="95"> We did a lot for urban development , just have a look at what we created between the Lichtburg cinema , the adult education center and the minster , have a walk along the cultural trail where you can experience interactions between works of art and architecture , from the minster to the Folkwang Museum along the blue stones . </seg>
<seg id="96"> We , and I , were able to shape numerous interactions and I experienced and realized what it means when different people from different areas together pursue one goal . </seg>
<seg id="97"> You might have noticed , I'm getting away from art more and more , rather turning to culture , which defines us , which focuses on the binding element between people , between cultures , between communities , to put it in another way , but I will come back to art later . </seg>
<seg id="98"> On the tenth of January two thousand and one , interaction between the cities of the Ruhr Area also became an issue of interest when we , seven department heads , had the idea that the Ruhr Area could apply for European Capital of Culture . </seg>
<seg id="99"> But nevertheless , this last chapter , this fifth chapter is entitled Identification . </seg>
<seg id="100"> This word has two meanings , first, I identify with something , thus , I am committed to something , second , I can also use it as a verb and say , I identify something , meaning that I recognize something . </seg>
<seg id="101"> And always with its distinct features . </seg>
<seg id="102"> I recognize something with its features , that's why I say , I identify you or him or this community . </seg>
<seg id="103"> And I identify with something if I am committed to it and say , this belongs to me , I want to identify with this . </seg>
<seg id="104"> And that was a really huge action . </seg>
<seg id="105"> Trying to mobilize five point three million people , fifty three cities , to identify in both senses , to be committed and to realize that we are a community within Europe . </seg>
<seg id="106"> A huge , as we then called it , metropolis , at least a community of many people living in a huge conurbation and speaking a common language , though from one hundred and forty nations , and our main task was to initiate identification among the people and also to learn from them , of course . </seg>
<seg id="107"> At SchachtZeichen , at the motorway closure , at many other events . </seg>
<seg id="108"> There was one experience in the context of the European Capital of Culture only a few people were aware of . </seg>
<seg id="109"> Two schools , Nizhny Novgorod and Essen , worked together , young pupils from the girls' grammar school in Borbeck as well as young pupils from a German school in Nizhny Novgorod rewrote letters of young men from Stalingrad into a theater play , final letters dealing with home , farewell , love , death . </seg>
<seg id="110"> And it was a special moment indeed , young girls quoting letters of young men and then young Russians quoting letters of young men from Germany in slightly broken German . </seg>
<seg id="111"> And suddenly , one of these young men sat down at the piano and played this Chopin waltz which I absolutely adored . </seg>
<seg id="112"> Oh , and then he quoted from a letter and said , I'm a pianist , it was a letter home , he played a young German in the play , and never again I will be able to play a Chopin waltz again for I just lost two fingers due to frostbite . </seg>
<seg id="113"> And he wrapped his fingers with a gauze bandage , sat down at the piano again during this theater play at the Zeche Carl and tried to play the Chopin waltz . </seg>
<seg id="114"> And he failed . </seg>
<seg id="115"> It was such a moving scene , I stepped forward and asked , what have we learned today ? </seg>
<seg id="116"> In the Capital of Culture we've learnt that together , many people can achieve a lot , but first and foremost we've learnt that in Central Europe , we've been living in peace for sixty years now and that culture is the binding element preventing us from fighting each other merely because of the fact that we speak different languages , that we identify with each other , that we belong somewhere . </seg>
<seg id="117"> And that was a wonderful experience for me and you will notice that learning is not just about knowledge . </seg>
<seg id="118"> Learning is always about gaining experience and power of judgment . </seg>
<seg id="119"> And if we are creative and accept creativity , inventions , if we take our inspiration from art and culture to take our own stand , in communicating with art , if we interact and ultimately work continuously on our own identity by dealing with art and culture , then all of us will profit . </seg>
<seg id="120"> And I hope that you will have numerous artistic and cultural experiences from which you can benefit . </seg>
<seg id="121"> Thank you . </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="Sterben" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> Well , thank you very much . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I suggest we just wait for the first picture . </seg>
<seg id="3"> So I have put some slides here to support my memory . </seg>
<seg id="4"> However , these are no scientific slides , but in my talk I rather want to find a direction and deal with a subject which I think is going to be a matter of great concern to us in the years to come . </seg>
<seg id="5"> After the introduction I finally know now , thank you very much for that , what TED actually means , and I think this talk can indeed be classified in the field of education . </seg>
<seg id="6"> And then I had also heard that the talk should be given in English if possible , but wenn you look at this you see that you would not understand what I wanted to say in English , I would not know immediately how to say it and this is why I have left the talk in German after all . </seg>
<seg id="7"> How we are going to die . </seg>
<seg id="8"> Regarding this , I need to tell you about Rosalinde first . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Rosalinde was a patient in the hospital where I am in charge of the radiology department , and she had fallen . </seg>
<seg id="10"> She was over ninety years old and always loved dancing into May because it also made her remember her husband , her first husband , who had died in the war . </seg>
<seg id="11"> And so she went to dance every year on the first of May and danced until late and probably drank a glass of punch too much once and ended up falling and broke , you can see it here on the right side , her leg , her femoral neck . </seg>
<seg id="12"> She had already fallen once a couple of years before and had broken her left leg in the same way at the same occasion . </seg>
<seg id="13"> And at that time I was already working there as a doctor and saw how she spent weeks in the intensive care unit , how she was treated with antibiotics , also how she was resuscitated , and I overheard the discussion in which was said , does this even make sense after all ? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Does it even make sense to use such intensive methods to treat a person that old ? </seg>
<seg id="15"> That is to resuscitate , to give artificial respiration , in the intensive care unit for weeks , can you even expose somebody to that ? </seg>
<seg id="16"> And she was healed then . </seg>
<seg id="17"> Five years later I come into the clinic , see the name Rosalinde , and I can easily remember it because it is just so rare , even at that time , and she had , when she had been dancing into May , broken her other leg . </seg>
<seg id="18"> This raises the question , what is it actually that I discuss when I talk about how a person has to decide for himself what he writes in his living will or which health care proxies he signs ? </seg>
<seg id="19"> And this is more or less what the talk is about . </seg>
<seg id="20"> Here you see the forefather of the name , how we are going to die . </seg>
<seg id="21"> It is a nineteen-ninety-seven book , how we are going to work , a report to the Club-of-Rome . </seg>
<seg id="22"> And at that time glottalization was advancing in such a strong way that you asked yourself , what can interconnected work look like ? </seg>
<seg id="23"> So they said , and you can still look that up in the book today , there will be a quality control , so that the parts always fit together . </seg>
<seg id="24"> There will be an interconnection of work processes , there will also be much more outsourcing , to China for example , that was a major topic at that time . </seg>
<seg id="25"> And this is how it turned out then , that basically the work of the individual , that is assembling something , manufacturing something , was becoming worth less and less , that there was more and more control also of the quality he delivers , of the accuracy . </seg>
<seg id="26"> And that , in my estimation , people were less and less confident of their work and became more and more part of a little wheelwork , which was all about achieving the highest value creation possible , and not about also defining yourself by your work anymore . </seg>
<seg id="27"> And now if we apply this to the nursing care and medical sector , then , of course , there is a similar development . </seg>
<seg id="28"> When you hear on TV what doctors , nurses , and also geriatric nurses complain about most , it 's the so called documentation requirements . </seg>
<seg id="29"> And this means they have to document what they have done so that it is enforceable , so that it gets even paid at all , and if it isn't documented , the Medical Service might say , we will not pay this care or this medical treatment . </seg>
<seg id="30"> But because of this documentation the work of the nurses increasingly loses its value and the thought of fulfilling one's task and contributing it with commitment out of personal conviction is being neglected while they are being controlled , punished , and not considered credible . </seg>
<seg id="31"> A good friend of mine has gone to Holland now , because he had enough of how things were done here , he had a general medical practice , gave it up and went to Holland to become a geriatric physician . </seg>
<seg id="32"> More often than not , the Dutch are a step ahead when it comes to developments like this and what he , Martin , had experienced was that more and more old people commute between nursing home , hospital , back and forth , because the nursing home didn't know what to do anymore when a person's health declined . </seg>
<seg id="33"> They are hospitalized then , have their health restored , go back to the retirement home or nursing home and are further looked after . </seg>
<seg id="34"> And so this general practitioner had thought , if in Holland there is something organized like this , then I would like to be trained there in order to promote some change here , so that there is a chance to escape from this vicious cycle of lacking credibility and undignified treatment of human beings . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Now , having arrived there in Holland , after it had taken him a lot of effort to learn the language , he had to discover that what is happening there is exactly what happened in this how-we-are-going-to-work . </seg>
<seg id="36"> Dying , too , is more and more subject to an introduction of quality control . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Credibility is no longer what counts , but at one point in an injunction you determine , for example , I don't want to be resuscitated or I don't want to be hospitalized when I am in a nursing home . </seg>
<seg id="38"> And this is respected then . </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the Netherlands it goes like this , on the third day , a conversation is held with the newly arrived residents , and then they have to decide , do I want to be hospitalized or do I not want to be hospitalized anymore , if something happens to me . </seg>
<seg id="40"> It's the same with , I want to be resuscitated or I don't want to be resuscitated . </seg>
<seg id="41"> This data is sent to the central administration and that's where this geriatric physician is , who always has the medical records before him and decides on this basis . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Now if we think back to Rosalinde , who as I said liked dancing into May and had fallen once , and we imagine that at some point she had written a living will stating , I don't want to be resuscitated , then this second dancing into May , where , admittedly , she fell a second time , she would not have lived to see . </seg>
<seg id="43"> And now my friend , who is over there in Holland , is worrying about how to deal with this . </seg>
<seg id="44"> In fact , today , about sixty to seventy per cent of people do not die at home anymore , but in hospitals , nursing facilities , and on top of that , these nursing facilities are , you can see it that way , not the ideal living space for elderly people after all , but there is often a financially narrow leeway , the nursing staff is often over-strained and the promotion in itself of being alive happens , in my opinion , only to a limited extend . </seg>
<seg id="45"> Certainly , there are homes in which this is done very well , there are very enthusiastic people who get involved there , but when I look at the overall balance , and we have twelve thousand patients per year , so about five , six thousand perhaps , who are perhaps admitted to us from the nursing homes , then I personally would say , it is indeed difficult to get along there and keep up your inner self-confidence . </seg>
<seg id="46"> Of course , this whole issue has pecuniary reasons , that's for sure , this whole quality control , this control has been established because after all there is not enough money for all people to be taken care of in the best possible way and in full scope , and for the people who provide the care or the medical treatments to be payed in such a way that they can say , I'm doing fine with this , I as a nurse can , for example , feed a family with one or two children . </seg>
<seg id="47"> This simply isn't today's reality , but you need two incomes in the nursing and geriatric sector and in most cases even this is just enough . </seg>
<seg id="48"> This introduction of quality control as a consequence of a steadily growing market one wants to regulate also has an impact for the concerned individuals . </seg>
<seg id="49"> And now I come to how one might be able to evade this , so what do we do after all , because I have started by asked questions and have shown that the situation is not all that easy for the persons concerned . </seg>
<seg id="50"> And in this respect I have simply dusted off the German basic law and picked out article one , because I think a society always needs structures like this , legal structures also , which serve as a foundation for the whole thing , for what happens in our society . </seg>
<seg id="51"> And after all in the basic law article one it says , human dignity shall be inviolable . </seg>
<seg id="52"> And the second sentence there says , to protect it shall be the duty of all state authority . </seg>
<seg id="53"> And what I sometimes miss is yet a third sentence saying that each individual person for himself should also have the mission to protect and defend his dignity . </seg>
<seg id="54"> Because this is a way to free yourself from this trap where you say I pass this on to others and they shall somehow look after me and take care of me so that at least I don't have to think much about how I am going to die one day . </seg>
<seg id="55"> Because after all that's how it is , although we don't like to face this matter , one day we will arrive at that point . </seg>
<seg id="56"> Hopefully not until late , at the age of hundred or a hundred and ten . </seg>
<seg id="57"> Of course , it is according to my job to say , I wish this for everyone and that's also what I want to provide for , but at some point one will have to face this subject , and then when this happens or simply , when you are seventy-five , eighty-five , or ninety-five , it can be late in life already , to say , I want to think about this question now . </seg>
<seg id="58"> When the time has come to think about it , what does my dignity consist of , then in the end you will think of aspects which reveal , what were the five most important things for me in my life after all ? </seg>
<seg id="59"> There is a book now that is quite in vogue . </seg>
<seg id="60"> It is self-respect , of course , then it is the friends I have , with whom I can discuss and exchange experiences , who know me and who accompany me through life , it is the family members . </seg>
<seg id="61"> It surely is the confidence between people , with which I might also be involved , in the geriatric sector or in the medical sector or a priest or a lawyer or another person with whom I enter into a relationship . </seg>
<seg id="62"> And of course there are many individual factors which play a role , I won't go through all of them now . </seg>
<seg id="63"> But when you start to consider these three points , then you have a number of tasks already , how you may have to orient yourself in life to protect your own dignity in the end . </seg>
<seg id="64"> And then there is another factor , that we experience a certain dictatorship of the do-gooders , I have taken this here as a text or as an example for that . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Other people cannot make these necessary decisions or comply with the behavior that is going to be required . </seg>
<seg id="66"> That is my firm conviction . </seg>
<seg id="67"> Our dignity can only come from within ourselves . </seg>
<seg id="68"> So the question is not , what will others do for me , who will take care of me , nurse me , or who will speak up for me , who will approach me ? </seg>
<seg id="69"> But it is exactly the other way round , to ask , where can I reach out to people , where can I get involved and gain dignity , so that I can deal with these questions and take a stand and adjust myself . </seg>
<seg id="70"> And then when it says , how we are going to work , so this quality control that has been imposed to us from outside , then one possibility to escape from this mechanism is to say , I define myself by my inner dignity . </seg>
<seg id="71"> Because nobody can tell me how I want to see myself and which position I want to adopt . </seg>
<seg id="72"> And I don't have to conform with general moods and opinions , which say , you have to fill in a living will now and since you are that old already , consider carefully whether you want to be resuscitated or whether you want to be taken to the intensive care unit . </seg>
<seg id="73"> After all , these are questions I can only , probably , treat conclusively after long preparatory work . </seg>
<seg id="74"> This human dignity is an inner posture that lies inside of me and that cannot be transmitted from outside , that cannot be protected by the state , nor by law , and that other people , too , can allow to me and might be more likely to allow to me , when I have dealt with them myself before , so that they know what kind of person I am . </seg>
<seg id="75"> And such conversations need spaces and regarding this I think , and this is how I thought of the title for this talk , and prepared here , such spaces like the Kreuzeskirchenviertel in Essen , I have tried to acquaint you with both on an image , spaces , where we need to think about subjects like this , where there is a protected space , so that it is not offending , that maybe it is not too theoretical , but that above all an exchange takes place there . </seg>
<seg id="76"> So that , when we are old , we are in the position to say , wow , a dance into May , despite my possibly very old age , that would be nice again . </seg>
<seg id="77"> Thank you very much for your attention . </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="Unendlichkeit" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> A very nice evening . </seg>
<seg id="2"> I brought two things . </seg>
<seg id="3"> If the first part is too boring for you , try to stay awake . </seg>
<seg id="4"> There will be a second one . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Let's start with the infinite . </seg>
<seg id="6"> That's nonsense , right , it might take some time . </seg>
<seg id="7"> What do you think ? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Do different infinities exist ? </seg>
<seg id="9"> Or is one infinity simply enough ? </seg>
<seg id="10"> Yes ! </seg>
<seg id="11"> It's not that good having somebody here who understands this matter ! </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well , in fact , but I'm going to keep it short , for those who know the issue . </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is quite the opposite of what we're doing . </seg>
<seg id="14"> We're dealing with just one infinity . </seg>
<seg id="15"> And I'd like to see that in contrast to finitude . </seg>
<seg id="16"> We know finitude , we imagine to know infinity . </seg>
<seg id="17"> And for the maths freaks , it's all about the order of quantities . </seg>
<seg id="18"> We're dealing with finitude and counting two object quantities , let's say , the first one is chairs , the second one is people . </seg>
<seg id="19"> Let's say , when looking into the box , we already know that it's a small number , three chairs and three people . </seg>
<seg id="20"> How can we check whether each quantity contains the same number of elements ? </seg>
<seg id="21"> If we counted , how would we do that ? </seg>
<seg id="22"> That means , at first we would count people, one , two , three , we have got three , we would count chairs , we see three chairs , one , two , three , that's it , wonderful . </seg>
<seg id="23"> You think so ? </seg>
<seg id="24"> Very good . </seg>
<seg id="25"> In finitude , this works perfectly , even with greater numbers, though it's annoying . </seg>
<seg id="26"> But it works . </seg>
<seg id="27"> Are there other ways to count ? </seg>
<seg id="28"> Are there other ways to check whether we have as many people as chairs ? </seg>
<seg id="29"> I've deliberately chosen chairs and people and nothing else . </seg>
<seg id="30"> Let them sit on the chairs . </seg>
<seg id="31"> This is called coupling ! </seg>
<seg id="32"> You alright , that's obvious , isn't it , as soon as we're dealing with daily life situations , everyone understands ! </seg>
<seg id="33"> Right , this is nice . </seg>
<seg id="34"> Well , the professional term would be coupling function and this is exactly how it works , right ? </seg>
<seg id="35"> You take somebody , put him on a chair , that's it . </seg>
<seg id="36"> The next couple , done , the next couple , everything fits perfectly , different people get different chairs , no chair remains empty and quantities are equal , okay ? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Now , let's move over to the infinite . </seg>
<seg id="38"> How can we compare two infinite quantities with each other ? </seg>
<seg id="39"> We would say , one quantity is that large or larger or smaller than the other one . </seg>
<seg id="40"> What can we do ? </seg>
<seg id="41"> Again, we would start to . </seg>
<seg id="42"> Exactly , that's wrong because the point is , if you started counting an infinitely large quantity , yes , I'd simply say , you wouldn't get to the other one . </seg>
<seg id="43"> Infinite , right , it's obvious , right ? </seg>
<seg id="44"> So , how does it work ? </seg>
<seg id="45"> Madam ? </seg>
<seg id="46"> No , Madam ! </seg>
<seg id="47"> She had just started off correctly ! </seg>
<seg id="48"> Coupling ! </seg>
<seg id="49"> Well , let's have a look at that now . </seg>
<seg id="50"> Making a guess is rather inappropriate in the infinite , right ? </seg>
<seg id="51"> You don't see an end , right ? </seg>
<seg id="52"> The point is , there is a simple approach . </seg>
<seg id="53"> Let's say , I were using the number line , natural numbers , no , we as computer specialists need zero at the start , zero , one , two , three , four , five . </seg>
<seg id="54"> And let's say , we had a copy of this line and took away the infinite number of odd numbers from the copy . </seg>
<seg id="55"> The even numbers would remain , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , right ? </seg>
<seg id="56"> Okay ? </seg>
<seg id="57"> All even numbers are on the infinite line of natural numbers , but on the one line , the odd numbers are missing , on the other line , both even and odd numbers are included , okay ? </seg>
<seg id="58"> Let's call the quantity of even numbers G , the quantity of natural numbers N . </seg>
<seg id="59"> What do you think ? </seg>
<seg id="60"> Is G mightier , is it larger than N , the same or smaller ? </seg>
<seg id="61"> The same ? </seg>
<seg id="62"> That's quite audacious , yes , for the odd numbers are missing in that quantity . </seg>
<seg id="63"> Would anyone else like to make a guess ? </seg>
<seg id="64"> Smaller ? </seg>
<seg id="65"> Who says larger ? </seg>
<seg id="66"> Ah , she actually has no idea , right ? </seg>
<seg id="67"> This can't be true either , right ? </seg>
<seg id="68"> It can't be larger when something is missing , that doesn't work , right ? </seg>
<seg id="69"> Okay , you say smaller ? </seg>
<seg id="70"> One would think so , right ? </seg>
<seg id="71"> That's the common thing , what you would expect is of course wrong . </seg>
<seg id="72"> And now I'm going to explain you , why the quantities are equal . </seg>
<seg id="73"> How does it work ? </seg>
<seg id="74"> Exactly . </seg>
<seg id="75"> Yes , we couple . </seg>
<seg id="76"> That's the point . </seg>
<seg id="77"> We couple . </seg>
<seg id="78"> We take zero from the even quantity , we take zero from the natural quantity , we couple , we exclude . </seg>
<seg id="79"> The next after zero , after plus two comes two , after zero comes one , and I have a couple again . </seg>
<seg id="80"> Four , two , six , three , eight , four , okay ? </seg>
<seg id="81"> You can also reverse this , then it will be doubled , that's obvious , isn't it ? </seg>
<seg id="82"> It's crystal clear that this is possible through coupling , in the lecture , I always demonstrate this using an exercise band . </seg>
<seg id="83"> On this one right here , only the even numbers are included , still the band is equally large , right ? </seg>
<seg id="84"> We reduce the natural numbers to the even ones , the odd numbers are gone and the band is still equally large . </seg>
<seg id="85"> Only in the infinite , this is possible . </seg>
<seg id="86"> So , if you tell anybody about what we've learned today , we've learned about the infinite , yes , what does infinite mean , I only know finite ? </seg>
<seg id="87"> An infinite quantity has one quality which does not exist in finitude and this is an absolute characteristic , a genuine subset which is equally large . </seg>
<seg id="88"> This is not possible in finitude , if you send home two people out of three , only one will remain and beforehand , there were three . </seg>
<seg id="89"> Yes , with that , we have achieved the infinite . </seg>
<seg id="90"> Did anybody fall asleep ? </seg>
<seg id="91"> Alright . </seg>
<seg id="92"> Let's have a second part then , probability . </seg>
<seg id="93"> The professionals , conditional probability . </seg>
<seg id="94"> I brought you something . </seg>
<seg id="95"> I'm sure that at least one third of you will know this experiment and woe to those of them who participate nevertheless , right ? </seg>
<seg id="96"> So , let's call these doors A , B , C . </seg>
<seg id="97"> I've hidden something behind one of them , I hope you haven't noticed . </seg>
<seg id="98"> And you should first make a guess . </seg>
<seg id="99"> Where do you think have I hidden something , behind A , B or C ? </seg>
<seg id="100"> Make a guess , right here , our guessing expert . </seg>
<seg id="101"> You think it is C . </seg>
<seg id="102"> Any other ideas ? </seg>
<seg id="103"> A ? </seg>
<seg id="104"> Does anybody else have an idea ? </seg>
<seg id="105"> Well done , no , B was missing , right , otherwise , he will never stop , right ? </seg>
<seg id="106"> That's right . </seg>
<seg id="107"> It really doesn't matter , you mustn't think all three letters will be mentioned and I will choose one . </seg>
<seg id="108"> It doesn't matter , right ? </seg>
<seg id="109"> This is crystal clear , for the probability that you're lucky in the end is just one third . </seg>
<seg id="110"> There are three doors , it really doesn't matter , right ? </seg>
<seg id="111"> Now I'll be doing the following , I will simply open one . </seg>
<seg id="112"> Fair enough , of course I know where it is . </seg>
<seg id="113"> Woe betide anyone who , right . </seg>
<seg id="114"> So , I know where it lies and the guessing or estimating or however you want to call it goes into a second round . </seg>
<seg id="115"> So , I'm going to explain the rules just now on the fly . </seg>
<seg id="116"> It goes as follows , we're going into a second round . </seg>
<seg id="117"> Now , assuming I choose A , right ? </seg>
<seg id="118"> Right, now I'll have to show you a door behind which nothing is hidden and which you didn't guess . </seg>
<seg id="119"> Because if you say B now , I know that it is not hidden behind B . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Then there would be no second round . </seg>
<seg id="121"> I'd say , nyah nyah nyah , just my luck , end of game . </seg>
<seg id="122"> But I have to go into the second round , for these are the rules . </seg>
<seg id="123"> Thus , I can only open a door behind which both nothing is hidden and which you didn't guess . </seg>
<seg id="124"> Now one question remains , and this is the conditional probability , given that B is open and there is nothing behind it , you've got one last chance to make a new guess . </seg>
<seg id="125"> You can now stick to A, then I will conclusively open A . </seg>
<seg id="126"> I will open the door you will choose . </seg>
<seg id="127"> Or you say , I'm going to open C . </seg>
<seg id="128"> Now the maths question is , has the probability increased having this knowledge at hand ? </seg>
<seg id="129"> Puh , very good , B is open , now I know it is behind C . </seg>
<seg id="130"> Or , thank God that B has been opened , I always wanted to stick to A , that's it . </seg>
<seg id="131"> Or would you say , now it's fifty-fifty after all , no , forget it , there are only two doors remaining , now it doesn't matter whether you switch or stay . </seg>
<seg id="132"> What do you think ? </seg>
<seg id="133"> It does matter . </seg>
<seg id="134"> Fifty-fifty . </seg>
<seg id="135"> Why does it matter ? </seg>
<seg id="136"> Very good . </seg>
<seg id="137"> Why is it fifty-fifty ? </seg>
<seg id="138"> Yes , exactly , that's wrong . </seg>
<seg id="139"> It sort of seems as though we had practiced that yesterday , right ? </seg>
<seg id="140"> But that's them , right , a new no , just kidding . </seg>
<seg id="141"> Alright , here is how it goes , it's quite simple , yes . </seg>
<seg id="142"> Everyone understands this from the age of six to , I don't know , well , I mustn't say sixty , otherwise I won't be part of this rather soon , right ? </seg>
<seg id="143"> So , actually everyone understands this . </seg>
<seg id="144"> There is a probability of one third that it lies behind this door . </seg>
<seg id="145"> And the probability that it lies behind one door is always just one third . </seg>
<seg id="146"> You can make any guess you want , there is always a two thirds probability that you are wrong . </seg>
<seg id="147"> That means , if you would have had two guesses , right , in roulette you can do this , you can gamble on two dozens , right , if you left out zero , all this is possible in real life . </seg>
<seg id="148"> But here , we only have one door . </seg>
<seg id="149"> Right , here is how it goes , it's not two thirds that you guess . </seg>
<seg id="150"> So the two thirds lie here , but they can only be behind one door after all ! </seg>
<seg id="151"> It's not behind this door ! </seg>
<seg id="152"> So , what's more likely then ? </seg>
<seg id="153"> No , I've actually hidden it somewhere ! </seg>
<seg id="154"> So , what's more likely now ? </seg>
<seg id="155"> Is it better to stay or to switch ? </seg>
<seg id="156"> Now it's easy , right ? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Yes , of course ! </seg>
<seg id="158"> Well , that wasn't too difficult , right ? </seg>
<seg id="159"> Ha ! </seg>
<seg id="160"> What do we learn from this ? </seg>
<seg id="161"> You were unlucky . </seg>
<seg id="162"> Why ? </seg>
<seg id="163"> It's simple , even two thirds are not one hundred percent : this is the difference between theory and practice . </seg>
<seg id="164"> I hope all of you could profit from this lecture . </seg>
<seg id="165"> Thank you very much . </seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="Vertrauen" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> Mr Reichert , it is completely depressing that you announce me right after Jamie Oliver who had just finished talking about unhealthy diet , bad food and overweight people . </seg>
<seg id="2"> But I'll try my best to wash away these impressions . </seg>
<seg id="3"> Because I grew up on a Demeter farm and until I was twelve years old, I didn't know McDonald's . </seg>
<seg id="4"> What an introduction , exactly . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Well . </seg>
<seg id="6"> Thank you very much for today's invitation . </seg>
<seg id="7"> I grew up not far away from here . </seg>
<seg id="8"> And I'm not sure whether this was the reason Mr Reichert came up with the idea to ask me if I wanted to participate in TED at the lake and talk about a certain topic . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Today , I chose : the topic trust . </seg>
<seg id="10"> Motivation is clearly a decent topic , too , and I can only agree with Mrs Reichert who said that maybe after that , one or the other will do more sport . </seg>
<seg id="11"> I'd be in for that . </seg>
<seg id="12"> Well , given that it's raining this evening , going jogging might be a little over-the-top , but I have to work out tomorrow because in three weeks , on the twenty second of June , at midsummer , I will be driving from Trondheim to Oslo by bike - that's four hundred and fifty kilometers . </seg>
<seg id="13"> Meaning that I'm not spared the training tomorrow just because of the rain . </seg>
<seg id="14"> So , if you want to join in cycling , it starts tomorrow morning in Abendtal , you're all welcome . </seg>
<seg id="15"> I already briefly mentioned that I'll be talking about trust today . </seg>
<seg id="16"> And on purpose , I started with the topic of basic trust . </seg>
<seg id="17"> No worries , the beautiful , slightly hackneyed , blind trust will be addressed later . </seg>
<seg id="18"> Earlier , on my journey to this place , I was briefly thinking about how I could best describe where I come from . </seg>
<seg id="19"> So , I come from a village with six houses , lots of apple trees , some hop poles and on my parents' farm we have apples , apple juice and hop , and what do you make of hop , beer . </seg>
<seg id="20"> In sport , trust of course doesn't mean doping to me but apple juice and beer . </seg>
<seg id="21"> Why am I telling the story of my origin ? </seg>
<seg id="22"> For me it's one of the most important stories that I actually grew up in the countryside , that I grew up in a village with two big brothers , the oldest being the one who sees . </seg>
<seg id="23"> The second being as blind as I am . </seg>
<seg id="24"> Meaning that he sees bright and dark , like me , he can recognize a window in a room , whether the light is turned on or not . </seg>
<seg id="25"> Which is quite useful for today's electricity bill . </seg>
<seg id="26"> He , or the two of us can see when something is right in front of us . </seg>
<seg id="27"> A post for example , but I always say that I cannot tell the difference between a post and a man . </seg>
<seg id="28"> So much for the topic of old men , right . </seg>
<seg id="29"> Always make connections . </seg>
<seg id="30"> To start with , for me one question has of course always been essential , that is , how do you come to trust somebody and how do you gain this great trust , the basic trust that we all need , in a rather special situation , I dare say . </seg>
<seg id="31"> And the situation was definitely special for my parents , given that , this might as well apply to you , they didn't know any blind people before my brother and me. </seg>
<seg id="32"> We were the first to rather suddenly turn up in their life out of the blue . </seg>
<seg id="33"> And then they somehow had to deal with this situation . </seg>
<seg id="34"> And I think it was more than fortunate that being farmers , my parents didn't have all day to stand next to us and take our hands to lead us or to say , there's a wall , just grope your way along the wall and then you can feel where you are going . </seg>
<seg id="35"> A, it would have been unpleasant - we have woodchip wallpaper at home . </seg>
<seg id="36"> And B , our parents encouraged us right from the start to always go where our seeing brother is . </seg>
<seg id="37"> Thus , to run around the house alone , to run the stairs up and down , to risk something . </seg>
<seg id="38"> At that time, my blind brother pushed me across the yard with a toy tractor and under a trailer . </seg>
<seg id="39"> Even today , I still have that scar . </seg>
<seg id="40"> Well , big brothers - not just good for the elbows but also for cosmetic flaws . </seg>
<seg id="41"> And our brothers , and my brothers and I , outside the farm building , we did whatever possible , especially cycling . </seg>
<seg id="42"> And enthusiastically , the seeing brother started to ride the bicycle at the age of three and , of course , we also wanted to do so , Michael and I . </seg>
<seg id="43"> And then we started to cycle with stabilizers , similar to many small children in the past , today things have become much easier wit the run bike . </seg>
<seg id="44"> Until the kids are able to ride a bike . </seg>
<seg id="45"> But we started off using stabilizers , after some time , we went without them . </seg>
<seg id="46"> And then , the huge question arises : how do you orient yourself ? </seg>
<seg id="47"> And how do you gain trust , one the one hand , the parents' trust that the children will at some point in time get off the bike instead of falling down and , on the other hand , our trust that we will not permanently crash into something . </seg>
<seg id="48"> And our solution was of course , A , to listen to what our parents had to say , where to find risky spots , thus , where to find a car , where to find a trailer , where to find maybe even unusual things , fair enough , one cannot simply move houses , we knew where those were . </seg>
<seg id="49"> We had to orient ourselves in between them , we had to remember them but we also had to listen . </seg>
<seg id="50"> I'm afraid you won't be able to try that in here because otherwise , it would be so noisy , you wouldn't benefit . </seg>
<seg id="51"> But tonight , when you turn off the light and want to orient yourself in your bedroom or in anyone else's bedroom . </seg>
<seg id="52"> You can try to orient yourself by simply making a clicking noise with your tongue and you will notice , this applies for both human beings and bats , that you will hear resistance . </seg>
<seg id="53"> Comparable to bats which fly by using this radar , you will also be able to hear a wall approaching , thus , resistance , for sound is reflected differently . </seg>
<seg id="54"> And that has always been very important to me with regard to trust , thus , also regarding trust in movement . </seg>
<seg id="55"> If possible , to have maximum protection as well as the confidence , I have the opportunity to somehow help myself . </seg>
<seg id="56"> And to orient myself without much difficulty and obviously , without many accidents , of course there have already been some . </seg>
<seg id="57"> Of which , unfortunately , I haven't got any pictures left , I totally regret this myself , this was one of our favorite sports when we were children . </seg>
<seg id="58"> Climbing the higher buildings on our farm . </seg>
<seg id="59"> Here I've written down : to a certain extent , self-confidence grows with diversity . </seg>
<seg id="60"> And I mean that literally , because as a person that dealt with trust on the scientific side particularly later on during my pedagogy studies and my coaching education , I never tripped the way I experienced it myself . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Perhaps I never perceived it that drastically . </seg>
<seg id="62"> Certainly , this also has to do with the fact that of course not everybody is able to experience it by experiments like I did . </seg>
<seg id="63"> Diversity is crucial when discovering our strengths , so that at some point we will know what we're good at , what our talents are and where our strengths can best be applied . </seg>
<seg id="64"> And again it was our brother who always took Michael and me onto the roofs of our house . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Then he would say : okay , this right here is a ridge . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Somewhere there , you can climb out of the window , at the hop drying machine for example . </seg>
<seg id="67"> And then Johannes went first , Michael after him and I was probably still playing the little girl , no no , I'm not sure . </seg>
<seg id="68"> But honestly : who likes to stay at the bottom ? </seg>
<seg id="69"> Well , I don't . </seg>
<seg id="70"> And neither the others , I'd say , for here we are , the generation of young women . </seg>
<seg id="71"> So ultimately , I went with them . </seg>
<seg id="72"> The consequence was that at some point , we were all sitting on the ridge and my father arrived in a tractor with a trailer and didn't even know what to say . </seg>
<seg id="73"> Because obviously trust disappears when others begin to doubt . </seg>
<seg id="74"> So if the father had said : for God's sake , help , help , help , then the danger that anybody of us would have got scared and would have got off the roof somehow , I don't know , in case of doubt , by falling , jumping , rolling down , would have been rather imminent . </seg>
<seg id="75"> But this never happened . </seg>
<seg id="76"> He always had to pull himself together , so that he would guide us down the roof or send Johannes on ahead who would then lead us back . </seg>
<seg id="77"> And I found it just wonderful for me that we had these opportunities . </seg>
<seg id="78"> But no worries , of course this is not a necessary precondition to be able to do competitive sport later in your life . </seg>
<seg id="79"> I found all the different sports that were always important in my life , well , interesting . </seg>
<seg id="80"> And in particular , all of these were extremely good because I could find out about : where are my limits , what might be my talents . </seg>
<seg id="81"> For instance , I would've never become a decent thrower . </seg>
<seg id="82"> I never had the upper body for that . </seg>
<seg id="83"> And I still don't like going to the gym . </seg>
<seg id="84"> I prefer to be outside in the rain . </seg>
<seg id="85"> Not at five degrees like today . </seg>
<seg id="86"> Or in the pouring rain , but I still prefer to be outside rather than inside . </seg>
<seg id="87"> But personally , I was always able to discover my strengths and rely on them by trying out different sports . </seg>
<seg id="88"> The first was judo , for example . </seg>
<seg id="89"> And that was quite nice for me because the coach of our judo club used to say : okay , we've got lots of seeing children , there should be some blind children , too . </seg>
<seg id="90"> It works just fine actually because you had to grab each other's judo suit anyway . </seg>
<seg id="91"> And then you feel what the other person is doing . </seg>
<seg id="92"> And I always found trust in that , though , obviously , the longer the competition went on , the more difficult it was for me because then , the other could maybe do something that I didn't notice . </seg>
<seg id="93"> So there was just one method , that is the trust in my own speed . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Grab the other one , put one foot on the groin , fall backwards yourself , throw the opponent over your head and then he lies down and the fight is over because you get the full score . </seg>
<seg id="95"> I won't try that here . </seg>
<seg id="96"> I considered to do it , but no . </seg>
<seg id="97"> I think this might be a little too risky now . </seg>
<seg id="98"> And there wouldn't be any volunteers , right ? </seg>
<seg id="99"> No . </seg>
<seg id="100"> Blast , I thought so . </seg>
<seg id="101"> Okay . </seg>
<seg id="102"> The next important sports for me in school were cross-country skiing and biathlon . </seg>
<seg id="103"> My parents have been Alpine skiers up to this day and they taught us Alpine skiing when we were children . </seg>
<seg id="104"> But when I went to school , one thing was always important to me : how can I exercise as much as possible even after school to burn off my surplus energy ? </seg>
<seg id="105"> So at school , one possibility was to do cross-country skiing . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Though I always thought : all this is kind of boring because cross-country skiing is for grandmas , I think . </seg>
<seg id="107"> I thought so back in the days , today that has changed . </seg>
<seg id="108"> Then at some point I said : well , I'll do the cross-country skiing course . </seg>
<seg id="109"> It was only then that I realized , gosh , again , this sport is so diverse because you need fitness , you need strength , a decent coordination and it's quite the team sport . </seg>
<seg id="110"> Ring ring - have you noticed the similarities to your own job ? </seg>
<seg id="111"> It's the same with cross-country skiing . </seg>
<seg id="112"> You'll only get faster , if you totally trust your own equipment . </seg>
<seg id="113"> If you trust your own performance capacity , thus , the strength you'll be able to transfer it to your skies at any condition , bad weather , soft snow , icy snow . </seg>
<seg id="114"> And in my case , if you also trust your team . </seg>
<seg id="115"> Because as a blind sportswoman , of course I am dependent on an assistant skier . </seg>
<seg id="116"> And never before have I experienced such a weird thing - I have to use this word - the previous speaker , there was only one , already did my exercise today . </seg>
<seg id="117"> But it doesn't matter , we will do it again anyway . </seg>
<seg id="118"> Or maybe I will spare you that . </seg>
<seg id="119"> I'll do another exercise with one of you later . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Because I always do one particular exercise when talking about blind trust , I want the audience to imagine what it's like to do cross-country skiing when you see nothing and go downhill at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour . </seg>
<seg id="121"> In cross-country skiing , it goes like this , you have two sticks in your hands . </seg>
<seg id="122"> So , obviously , no free hand , otherwise , I could simply bring my white stick and find the course myself . </seg>
<seg id="123"> That doesn't work . </seg>
<seg id="124"> Thus , I have to find another solution . </seg>
<seg id="125"> So I have my assistant skier who runs ahead of me . </seg>
<seg id="126"> And he explains the course with the voice . </seg>
<seg id="127"> So his explanations have to be accurate . </seg>
<seg id="128"> And this is also important for trusting . </seg>
<seg id="129"> Being accurate in communication, thus in the explanations . </seg>
<seg id="130"> The assistant skier always says hop , if the course runs straight ahead , he indicates left and right turns by saying : left , eleven o'clock , then I know it goes slightly left , so this refers to the upper part of the old-fashioned clock with hands . </seg>
<seg id="131"> If he says : left , ten o'clock , it goes a little sharper to the left , and if he says : right , ten o'clock . </seg>
<seg id="132"> Okay , did you all understand that ? </seg>
<seg id="133"> Of course , this is a problem because I have to ask again or he has to correct himself again , then I definitely know that something is wrong . </seg>
<seg id="134"> And this is the crucial thing for me , having the assistant skier running ahead of me , I have to throw myself upon his mercy , to put it in a negative way . </seg>
<seg id="135"> To put it in a positive way : he is my aid enabling me to be really fast and ideally , to be faster than the others starting in that same competition . </seg>
<seg id="136"> And I can only achieve that if I succeed in pulling myself off with both arms , in pushing me forward , in standing on one leg and now I actually have to close my eyes , ha , ha , or I can keep my eyes open , it makes no difference . </seg>
<seg id="137"> And then I have to ski like that and I have to stand on my other leg and I'm allowed to balance myself a little but actually , I have to stand as quietly as possible . </seg>
<seg id="138"> Even with high boots . </seg>
<seg id="139"> Yes , and this is most important for me when I do cross-country skiing , how do I manage to tell this guy , well , I say guy because I almost exclusively have men as assistant skiers , how do I manage to tell him : hey , I need accurate explanations because , obviously , he is the seeing person . </seg>
<seg id="140"> So he doesn't know what to tell me . </seg>
<seg id="141"> Consequently , I am the one to pave the way for communication . </seg>
<seg id="142"> And that's exactly as in any other working process . </seg>
<seg id="143"> If somebody doesn't know my needs , he will of course not be able to help me , so that it's my turn to say : alright , I need you to announce the next bend a little earlier . </seg>
<seg id="144"> Or , similar to cycling , I also need you to tell me how high the mountain is because when we go up the PfÃ¤nder mountain , at some point you inevitably start to think , we have to be at the top soon . </seg>
<seg id="145"> And then you push yourself again like a maniac and yet , you do not reach the top . </seg>
<seg id="146"> And therefore I occasionally need the pilot , as you'd say in cycling , at the front of the tandem , who tells me , unfortunately , we've only gone for twenty minutes until now , well , recently , we needed thirty six minutes , so sixteen minutes to go sounds much better. </seg>
<seg id="147"> Thus , it's important for me to have accurate , precise information . </seg>
<seg id="148"> I hear murmuring , anybody else also going up the PfÃ¤nder ? </seg>
<seg id="149"> Any more bids ? </seg>
<seg id="150"> Well , I used to be faster than that , but this was in September and now in April , May , so far I haven't been faster than thirty six minutes to be honest . </seg>
<seg id="151"> And with the recent weather conditions , it's really tough . </seg>
<seg id="152"> And for me , as I mentioned , these explanations will only be possible if I listen closely . </seg>
<seg id="153"> If the other person explains his surroundings accurately , thus , giving me the opportunity to perfectly measure my risks . </seg>
<seg id="154"> And this is one of the most important aspects leading me to the conclusion , trust is rather about training than the proverbial blind trust . </seg>
<seg id="155"> To be honest , I do not make much of blind trust as a blind person . </seg>
<seg id="156"> Because I already experienced that an assistant skier mixed up right and left in his explanations . </seg>
<seg id="157"> Which was rather unfortunate in that competition because off the track , there was an abyss going down three meters . </seg>
<seg id="158"> And I fell down three meters into the abyss . </seg>
<seg id="159"> So , as I mentioned , that was long ago , obviously an oversight . </seg>
<seg id="160"> I know that because the assistant skiers have to turn around , thus , they have to indicate directions in mirror image . </seg>
<seg id="161"> And it still happens a lot today that people tell me left , and then they say : no , the other left . </seg>
<seg id="162"> So it was actually right , unfortunately . </seg>
<seg id="163"> It doesn't make that much of a difference in daily life . </seg>
<seg id="164"> But obviously , in a stressful situation , you probably all know that from work or university , whatever , if things have to go quickly . </seg>
<seg id="165"> Precision is quite often a rather difficult challenge . </seg>
<seg id="166"> But for me , as I mentioned , blind trust particularly means being aware of the risks . </seg>
<seg id="167"> And as someone who doesn't see I have a huge advantage , to be honest , because in many ways I am aware of my risks . </seg>
<seg id="168"> Well , by now I know most of them in cross-country skiing . </seg>
<seg id="169"> Whether it's crashing into a tree , falling down a slope , deep snow , I know the risks but of course I also know , and this is the important thing , the positive aspects . </seg>
<seg id="170"> Which can be achieved if there is trust . </seg>
<seg id="171"> And if you've found somebody who is one hundred percent accurate in what he says , just how I need it . </seg>
<seg id="172"> And in particular , somebody who has the same goals . </seg>
<seg id="173"> Because with regard to trust , this is the next crucial aspect . </seg>
<seg id="174"> You have to have the same goal and you have to be clear about what it actually means to build trust . </seg>
<seg id="175"> Because one is often quick to use this term , it comes up easily . </seg>
<seg id="176"> I trust him or her or myself . </seg>
<seg id="177"> But the crucial point is , this means so much . </seg>
<seg id="178"> That you expose so much to establish trust . </seg>
<seg id="179"> Because we humans try to fill everything with a certain meaningfulness , we want to see the purpose behind it . </seg>
<seg id="180"> And most often , the purpose is to succeed in achieving a goal together . </seg>
<seg id="181"> That we succeed , in my case , for example , I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro some weeks ago . </seg>
<seg id="182"> And I knew exactly , I had to find someone who , in this case , I could trust to such an extent that I would be able to reach the top of the mountain . </seg>
<seg id="183"> And how do you manage to finally climb the top of the mountain successfully ? </seg>
<seg id="184"> Well , okay , of course I had the huge advantage not to be able to notice some things , for instance , if there was an abyss with a depth of hundred meters right next to me . </seg>
<seg id="185"> I didn't care about that . </seg>
<seg id="186"> This can actually be an advantage , for the fear of heights is not a problem anymore . </seg>
<seg id="187"> And I worked again and again to get a handle on the fear of heights , independent of climbing Mount Kilimanjaro I did things like bungee jumping or base flying in Berlin where you rappel from a hotel on a steel rope . </seg>
<seg id="188"> It's kind of scary standing up there and hearing the cars at the bottom , you do not have to see a lot to understand that when I fall , it's about to be painful . </seg>
<seg id="189"> And I always found such things interesting . </seg>
<seg id="190"> Obviously , to experience the rush of adrenalin but also to know , hey , I can do it , I can focus myself on that , pull myself together , and I can simply have a new experience , too . </seg>
<seg id="191"> And that's quite similar to the Mount Kilimanjaro experience because climbing a mountain goes as follows , each day you're walking for ten hours and at some point , it becomes just boring . </seg>
<seg id="192"> You're walking and walking , only surrounded by stones and less and less plants . </seg>
<seg id="193"> At first , you are accompanied by a ranger carrying along a rifle from before the First World War . </seg>
<seg id="194"> So if you see a buffalo somewhere , the ranger is probably the last one to shoot it . </seg>
<seg id="195"> This would be the only exciting thing . </seg>
<seg id="196"> We merely saw the buffaloes from a distance or even only the others saw them . </seg>
<seg id="197"> So I placed great trust in the ranger , despite the strange weapon he was carrying . </seg>
<seg id="198"> Because I thought : well , okay , as I just said , I would probably be better off running away than waiting for him to load his rifle . </seg>
<seg id="199"> But as I said , otherwise it was rather monotonous because there was not much happening around you . </seg>
<seg id="200"> It only gets really exciting when things become difficult . </seg>
<seg id="201"> Thus, when you reach higher altitudes and the air is thinner . </seg>
<seg id="202"> Or when you have an abyss right next to you , when there is only a narrow path and to your left and right , it goes down . </seg>
<seg id="203"> Then it got really exciting , and if , in addition to that , it was night and everyone is wearing a headlamp , the mountain guide sometimes used to say , now he'd rather prefer that I was secured with a rope so that he would actually have an eye and a grip on me . </seg>
<seg id="204"> Because I was the only one without a headlamp and sometimes , that was a bit too risky for him . </seg>
<seg id="205"> We established trust because I said : well , of course I can totally trust my companion , my friend who was with me , I know her and we properly discussed that beforehand . </seg>
<seg id="206"> But I need some sort of security so that I wouldn't have to concentrate permanently because , can you imagine if you're confronted with somebody on the mountain constantly saying , a stone on the left , right , one o'clock , left , eleven o'clock ? </seg>
<seg id="207"> At some point, you will go crazy , and not just you , everyone . </seg>
<seg id="208"> So in this case , trust meant for us to find a connection , so we tied a rope to her rucksack which I held in my hand and then I walked behind her along the dangling rope . </seg>
<seg id="209"> In the other hand , I had a walking stick so that I was able to feel the height of the steps . </seg>
<seg id="210"> And at some point , she just stepped firmly on a stone with her foot or she knocked against a stone with her walking stick so that I knew what was about to come and didn't have to concentrate permanently . </seg>
<seg id="211"> And this actually demonstrated how wonderful it is to , obviously , approach the top of the mountain sometime , that this goal is within arm's reach again , similar to the gold medals in cross-country skiing . </seg>
<seg id="212"> The other thing that I realized is that the trust I have in me is not just present when I pursue a goal like reaching the peak of a mountain . </seg>
<seg id="213"> It's also the others who build trust when they realize how it works . </seg>
<seg id="214"> So when we were climbing the mountain at night , me and my companion were mostly walking ahead of the seven other participants and they were relatively close behind us and after each break , someone else was behind us and I was already wondering , say , why are they staying why is everyone always so keen on walking right behind us ? </seg>
<seg id="215"> At night , you cannot even stare at the girls from behind . </seg>
<seg id="216"> Apparently , that was not the reason . </seg>
<seg id="217"> And at some point , I realized , ah okay , of course , their faith in their abilities ultimately had come to an end , too . </seg>
<seg id="218"> You're walking through the darkness of the night , you start at twelve o'clock , and at the beginning , there is no light . </seg>
<seg id="219"> That's really exhausting if you're overtired , the air gets thin , it's nothing but exhausting and , for the time being , far from being a pleasure . </seg>
<seg id="220"> And then at some point they said : wow , it was actually quite practical to walk behind you as my friend explained to me in detail what our surroundings looked like , we didn't stop talking , you know how it is with women . </seg>
<seg id="221"> We talked the whole night and so the rest of our group had a sort of confirmation , an encouragement as they knew , okay , now there's only one hour left , this is what she then told me . </seg>
<seg id="222"> Or I told her about something that was not at all related to our mountain trip . </seg>
<seg id="223"> And to know exactly that somebody is still there who might not feel good right now , too , we also talked about that , there's only one hour left , the sun is about to rise . </seg>
<seg id="224"> It's these things , even this mirror from outside which , once more , can enhance trust considerably and can contribute to the fact that thus you reach your personal gold medal . </seg>
<seg id="225"> And for me , trust is actually given and is given in its best possible way if at some point , the personal gold medal and what you really want to achieve is fully present in your imagination . </seg>
<seg id="226"> That's obvious , of course , with gold medals in sports which you bite into , I don't actually know why they do this , no idea , maybe to test the value or to check whether , in the end , there's only lead on the inside ? </seg>
<seg id="227"> Well , I think this is the case for some medals , in Vancouver , the medals had a weight of six hundred grams . </seg>
<seg id="228"> If that was supposed to be genuine gold , I wouldn't stand here , I would be in the Bahamas , I guess . </seg>
<seg id="229"> Or at least in Liechtenstein , somewhere in a tax haven like that . </seg>
<seg id="230"> But as I said , I think the actual reason why you do this is rather to be able to realize , what did I just create and how did I concentrate my abilities and strengths on one point . </seg>
<seg id="231"> How did I trust in me , in my abilities , but also in a team that we all need , regardless of whether it's in your studies , in your job , wherever . </seg>
<seg id="232"> Regardless of whether you're an old man or a young woman , we need people who we can trust . </seg>
<seg id="233"> And if we then focus clearly on this objective and also reach it , this is the best proof that at least in one project in our life , we were able to trust . </seg>
<seg id="234"> Because if you succeed in one area , you will definitely be able to do so in other areas . </seg>
<seg id="235"> Thank you very much , thank you . </seg>

<doc docid="Wissenschaft" genre="lectures">
<seg id="1"> A science for me , that's the title of my talk that has been created after your beautiful cards got printed . </seg>
<seg id="2"> What drives me is the deep wish to establish natural sciences in the everyday life of the general populace again . </seg>
<seg id="3"> Actually , I could be satisfied . </seg>
<seg id="4"> When I take a look at a bookstore , there are meters of shelves filled only with literature on scientific topics , which have been edited in a popular scientific way . </seg>
<seg id="5"> Even each newspaper stand offers a range of understandable popular scientific newspapers , journals , magazines , in which scientific topics , highly complex topics , are presented in a sort of understandable way . </seg>
<seg id="6"> Each TV channel has at least one television format dealing with scientific topics in one way or another . </seg>
<seg id="7"> Even , and this is totally absurd , if you look at how many journals and magazines for kids there are that deal with scientific topics . </seg>
<seg id="8"> Somehow each program already has an own offshoot on the shelf of the newspaper stand , but still this is purely about consuming . </seg>
<seg id="9"> Science is something that I may like to watch , that I may like to read about , but it does not really concern me . </seg>
<seg id="10"> The only time science is cool , that's somehow in CSI , in Breaking Bad , anywhere , that's where chemists are cool , isn't it ? </seg>
<seg id="11"> In C_S_I_ , a DNA fingerprint takes five minutes , which has nothing to do with reality , but it's cool , isn't it ? </seg>
<seg id="12"> That's something I can identify with . </seg>
<seg id="13"> Big Bang Theory , that's something I can laugh about , I don't understand the jokes , but it's great . </seg>
<seg id="14"> That is a great pity . </seg>
<seg id="15"> Because , somehow this is a little paradoxical , we will only be able to face the future with such technological questions and topics . </seg>
<seg id="16"> But at the same time nobody feels responsible for this . </seg>
<seg id="17"> I have gathered some small examples of the priority given to science or natural science especially by us . </seg>
<seg id="18"> One very famous example : a beautiful high-rise has been built in London , really amazing , the architect , let's build it kind of curvy , not so straight this time . </seg>
<seg id="19"> What happened , just now , that the sunlight falls from above into this front , I have provisionally indicated that , it is focused and then converges to a point somewhere in another district . </seg>
<seg id="20"> It received extensive press coverage , unfortunately just at that time there was a Jaguar parked there . </seg>
<seg id="21"> Too bad , the heat was concentrated in such a way that this poor Jaguar owner , who had been saving money for a really , really long time , the wing mirrors melted . </seg>
<seg id="22"> This makes you wonder , an architect like that , shouldn't he have learned this kind of thing in physics class , because , I mean , really , it's totally new that a mirror focuses things . </seg>
<seg id="23"> So , what I found , absolutely new , is Archimedes , sort of two hundred before Christ , when he allegedly sank a fleet using radiation . </seg>
<seg id="24"> This really makes me wonder , is he more of a designer or an architect or where did he study ? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now this is a particularly acute example . </seg>
<seg id="26"> Furthermore , a classic example of how important such recent topics are , is genetic engineering . </seg>
<seg id="27"> Genetic engineering , some years have passed since that was kind of entering the media . </seg>
<seg id="28"> At that point it was already too late , because genetically modified plants , that was suddenly dangerous . </seg>
<seg id="29"> Genes was synonymous with green genetic engineering . </seg>
<seg id="30"> Somehow , genes were something evil . </seg>
<seg id="31"> Right , oh , that contains genes . </seg>
<seg id="32"> It happened that the farmers on the market really advertised claiming : hey , I've got gene-free vegetables . </seg>
<seg id="33"> No idea what that's supposed to be , you know . </seg>
<seg id="34"> Well , yes , okay , Dutch tomatoes , that's debatable . </seg>
<seg id="35"> But at that time I was still working in the laboratory and at some point I was totally frustrated because I was trying to introduce those evil genes into my bacteria , those damned stupid things . </seg>
<seg id="36"> And I was totally frustrated , got home , and my neighbor back then : oh , you don't look happy , what's wrong ? </seg>
<seg id="37"> I was like : you know , I've been trying for three days to transform a little gene into my bacteria and that doesn't work at all . </seg>
<seg id="38"> That was what I was trying to explain , so some kind of double helix , genes , I thought , yes , that is sufficient , when I talk about genes , the lady will know what she means . </seg>
<seg id="39"> This was what I wanted to say , so a certain sequence which I wanted to get into those goddamn coli bacteria . </seg>
<seg id="40"> But this was what the lady understood . </seg>
<seg id="41"> This woman never shook my hand again ! </seg>
<seg id="42"> Who knows what I infect her with , you know ? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Genes are something absolutely evil . </seg>
<seg id="44"> That was a good ten years ago , and still somehow this got stuck in people's minds . </seg>
<seg id="45"> Gene , that is some kind of evil thing . </seg>
<seg id="46"> I haven't read the word gene-free for quite some time now . </seg>
<seg id="47"> It always says no genetic engineering , however , it has really found its way into our every day language . </seg>
<seg id="48"> Europe allows genetic super-corn , was one headline . </seg>
<seg id="49"> Genetic corn is fundamentally different from other corn that , as we know , doesn't contain any genes at all . </seg>
<seg id="50"> Another headline , genetic corn causes early death to rats . </seg>
<seg id="51"> Yes , that , too , was a nice headline . </seg>
<seg id="52"> But they are not very old and also it doesn't matter on which level I am . </seg>
<seg id="53"> No matter if the Zeit or the Bild , they all talk about genetic corn . </seg>
<seg id="54"> Fortunately it hasn't been added to the Duden yet , but I fear it won't be long before that happens . </seg>
<seg id="55"> But this simply shows the uncertainty prevailing amongst the populace , because they don't have enough insight in the subject . </seg>
<seg id="56"> However , we will have to deal with technologies like this in our future . </seg>
<seg id="57"> Only recently there have been parliamentary elections , nobody really had this subject on their program , but there are things elected and voted on of which most people don't really have an idea . </seg>
<seg id="58"> And that is quite said . </seg>
<seg id="59"> By the way , how does this information get out of the laboratory and into the public ? </seg>
<seg id="60"> If we assume that this little , young , motivated scientist is sitting in his laboratory , has an experiment , is doing research on something , good and well , and he thinks , man , now this is something , this will concern the public . </seg>
<seg id="61"> Then this has to go to the professor first . </seg>
<seg id="62"> Then the boss , he decides , okay , great topic , puts his name on it as first author , that's always important in science , being first author . </seg>
<seg id="63"> Good idea , however I'm not in the public yet , it's passed on to the spokesperson . </seg>
<seg id="64"> Well , the spokesperson thinks , oh , nice idea , great , we will make a press release for it . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Mhm , now we have a press release with a project , a nice idea , and then somehow this leaves the ivory tower . </seg>
<seg id="66"> Then it is published , yeah , but to whom , really ? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Now , these institutes are rarely on their own , usually several research institutes share one competent institution , one research community . </seg>
<seg id="68"> And out of all these the outputs , the really cool projects , are passed on by the spokespersons to the magazines , to the chief editors , be it Leibniz or Fraunhofer or Helmholtz or the Max Planck Society . </seg>
<seg id="69"> That's the way . </seg>
<seg id="70"> From the basis it is filtered more and more on its way up the ivory tower until finally the really , really cool experiments , the really noteworthy projects , appear in those magazines . </seg>
<seg id="71"> These are magazines of high quality , they are really well-made , they are for free , yes , but who do I reach ? </seg>
<seg id="72"> In fact , only those who are interested in it . </seg>
<seg id="73"> In the science communication we always call this the conversion of the catholics . </seg>
<seg id="74"> Meaning those , wo are already interested anyway , they also subscribe to the journal , yeah , good and well . </seg>
<seg id="75"> Beautiful magazines , reaching the target audience , those who are interested and who do maybe have a rough idea of what these articles actually are about . </seg>
<seg id="76"> But who do I really reach with this ? </seg>
<seg id="77"> The catholics , who are interested anyway . </seg>
<seg id="78"> No , now that was yes , the average consumer , I will call him Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze , who might read other publications , I have tried to keep it neutral , I don't really reach him that way . </seg>
<seg id="79"> Nonetheless , again , we will only be able to master our future if we deal with these future technologies . </seg>
<seg id="80"> Fracking , genetic technology , renewable energies , stem cell research , these are all subjects which are highly complex , but which Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze cannot really understand and on which he is supposed to vote somehow . </seg>
<seg id="81"> So my project , my idea is to use a different approach , to take this little , young , motivated scientist out of the ivory tower , to really separate him completely from his usual professional community and to have him take a course , a seminar , on how to communicate science in an understandable way . </seg>
<seg id="82"> Because what happens most of the time , that a scientist well , I have a friend , we have known each other for a good twenty years , he is an electrical engineer , it is an unwritten rule among us not to ask him about his job . </seg>
<seg id="83"> As soon as he opens his mouth and talks about his job we are left behind . </seg>
<seg id="84"> You know , that is the way scientists are , they tell you something about dihydrogen monoxide . </seg>
<seg id="85"> Whew , sounds chemical , doesn't it , chemical is almost about on the same level as genes . </seg>
<seg id="86"> Chemically treated , somehow that's something where you don't know what's behind it . </seg>
<seg id="87"> To really teach him , listen to me , that is good and well , when you are attending a conference and you want to tell your people , your professionals , something on eye level , then you are free to tell them about dihydrogen monoxid , but for heaven's sake , just call it water . </seg>
<seg id="88"> What is the big problem with really breaking it down and speaking normally ? </seg>
<seg id="89"> So I train , that's my idea , these young scientists , who are not yet that advanced in the hierarchy , who are still malleable to some extend , I teach them how to argue in an understandable way . </seg>
<seg id="90"> This is beneficial for everyone , third-party sponsors , investors , they also want to know what is going on there in the research institutes . </seg>
<seg id="91"> After all this is also about using taxpayers' money , so in fact they also have to communicate with the taxpayers . </seg>
<seg id="92"> But this training , that's just one part of the story . </seg>
<seg id="93"> On top of that , I really want to put them in front of a jury and have them present their project , their project in front of a jury , tough , merciless , honest , it couldn't be worse : kids . </seg>
<seg id="94"> There is a quote , I don't know if it's genuine , by Albert Einstein : if you can't explain it simply , you don't understand it well enough . </seg>
<seg id="95"> So , to take the scientists out of their laboratory and really reconsider their project asking how can I really communicate this in a way that a normal person understands ? </seg>
<seg id="96"> There are already a number of things like this . </seg>
<seg id="97"> Children's universities are totally modern , they are customary everywhere , at each university , but there , again , I actually only reach the catholics . </seg>
<seg id="98"> Who are the people who go to the most remote end of the town on some Sunday morning to attend a lecture at impossible hours ? </seg>
<seg id="99"> They are those who are interested anyway . </seg>
<seg id="100"> Then I have my newspaper reader again . </seg>
<seg id="101"> So these are the people who are interested anyway , who go there and listen to individual lectures . </seg>
<seg id="102"> That's nice , they do some kind of exciting experiments , everybody is satisfied , everybody is happy , goes home and that's it . </seg>
<seg id="103"> That is why I rely on a second aspect , which is to say , presenting the project one single time is not all there is to it . </seg>
<seg id="104"> These scientists are also trained on the way kids think . </seg>
<seg id="105"> Because many of them have really forgotten to focus on the essential . </seg>
<seg id="106"> Because scientists , the way they do research is identical to the way kids learn to know their world . </seg>
<seg id="107"> Kids work in an extremely scientific way . </seg>
<seg id="108"> They do anything , that is how they learn to walk . </seg>
<seg id="109"> They try something , does that work ? </seg>
<seg id="110"> Smack , falling down , no , doesn't work , next try , I change some of the parameters and do it once again . </seg>
<seg id="111"> Kids have an extremely scientific way of learning things . </seg>
<seg id="112"> These are really research processes , trial-and-error , I look what happens , which factors I need to change so that it works or not . </seg>
<seg id="113"> That is normal ! </seg>
<seg id="114"> But this is something many have forgotten . </seg>
<seg id="115"> That's why I think , the only way this can really work is when a mentoring partnership emerges afterwards and the scientists , over a longer period of time , do the kids' experiments in the neighborhood , in their surrounding area with kids from the kindergartens , from the elementary schools , on their eye-level , and they really get involved in it there , because I am convinced that the kids and the scientists speak the same language after all . </seg>
<seg id="116"> And then maybe , maybe someday , that is my hope , the kids talk about this at home and then I reach Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze as well , who is suddenly getting interested in scientific subjects , because the kids tell him about it . </seg>
<seg id="117"> Then that's not in some journal , that's not on Galileo , but his kids tell him something about having worked with a concave mirror , baking bread there , setting paper on fire , and then maybe he , too , shakes his head at how an architect can construct a building like this . </seg>
<seg id="118"> And not only do I then reach Mister Meier-MÃ¼ller-Schulze , of course , but also the newspaper reader . </seg>
<seg id="119"> That is my idea , my vision , my project . </seg>
<seg id="120"> Unfortunately at the moment the problem is that the first test candidates I called said , yeah , no , well , communication skills for our scientists , that's not on our schedule at the moment , they've got other priorities at the moment . </seg>
<seg id="121"> You know , a scientist doesn't need to be able to communicate . </seg>
<seg id="122"> And then I think , yeah , okay , I'll call the next one then . </seg>
<seg id="123"> But anyone who somehow works at an institute , who is electrical engineer in some company , whatever it is , the next break is coming up . </seg>
<seg id="124"> Thank you very much . </seg>

<seg id="15"> And I am going to tell you in the follow seventeen , eighteen minutes how it is to be the chief of a Zeppelin Airship Company . </seg>
<seg id="16"> I am the chief of the Zeppelin Airship Construction Company . </seg>
<seg id="17"> The company has been existing for one hundred and five years . </seg>
<seg id="18"> I am the chief of the Zeppelin Airship Technology Company . </seg>
<seg id="19"> This company has been existing for twenty years . </seg>
<seg id="20"> And chief of the EZR . </seg>
<seg id="21"> The company has been existing for approximately nineteen or eighteen years . </seg>
<seg id="22"> They run Zeppelin here at Lake Constance . </seg>
<seg id="23"> Zeppelin . </seg>
<seg id="24"> That is a photo I want to show you here , the small dot on the right , that is actually a dot , or something , I don't know , yes exactly this dot is still too big . </seg>
<seg id="25"> There are only twenty-three airships worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="26"> And from them , only ten are still active today . </seg>
<seg id="27"> And this means something . </seg>
<seg id="28"> There are about twenty thousand active commercial aircrafts worldwide . </seg>
<seg id="29"> Thus, this is actually no real market . </seg>
<seg id="30"> This is not even a niche . </seg>
<seg id="31"> This is a unicum , something exotic . </seg>
<seg id="32"> And there is also the question : why are people actually doing this ? </seg>
<seg id="33"> How does it actually work ? </seg>
<seg id="34"> A stock of twenty-three and only ten active ones , we can talk about the reason for that later . </seg>
<seg id="35"> Very shortly to the history . </seg>
<seg id="36"> In nineteen hundred an Earl , who many people described as crazy , founded the aircraft here . </seg>
<seg id="37"> A short summary . </seg>
<seg id="38"> Brought into being about eighteen aircrafts until nineteen fourteen , before the first World War . </seg>
<seg id="39"> Then during the first World War , by the way , Earl Zeppelin died in nineteen seventeen , about eighty-eight aircrafts were built for war's aim . </seg>
<seg id="40"> They then bombed London and so on and so forth . </seg>
<seg id="41"> And when we came to London in two thousand eight and flew there a campaign with a big beverage corporation for three months and the English newspapers where filled on both sides with the headline : this time they came , but not with bombs , but in peace . </seg>
<seg id="42"> And like this the story worked into it . </seg>
<seg id="43"> And we had a crazy campaign . </seg>
<seg id="44"> But Inbev , the client , was not so happy about it , because he suddenly realized what else there is behind , how many old memories are in it . </seg>
<seg id="45"> And well that was a bit critical for the people from the marketing . </seg>
<seg id="46"> But however it was a great campaign in London , apart from the weather in the North , up there the weather has already been very bad and very windy many years ago . </seg>
<seg id="47"> And we didn't fly a lot . </seg>
<seg id="48"> And then in nineteen twenty , in nineteen twenty-one Hugo Eckener took over . </seg>
<seg id="49"> And created a reparation aircraft that was then delivered to America . </seg>
<seg id="50"> This was the basis for a myth that the whole German nation began to feel something anew , when in nineteen twenty-four the aircraft was hijacked . </seg>
<seg id="51"> And then it was welcomed in New York with a parade of confetti . </seg>
<seg id="52"> And the whole German nation got up and yeah , again we are someone . </seg>
<seg id="53"> You can find this in every bibliography and this explains a bit the myth of this machine . </seg>
<seg id="54"> However , until nineteen thirty-seven only five , six , seven zeppelins were built and actually only two really big ones , the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg , that carried passengers . </seg>
<seg id="55"> Passengers , one hundred , about seventy-nine passengers and together it was at the end one hundred and nineteen . </seg>
<seg id="56"> But it was a myth . </seg>
<seg id="57"> And the Hindenburg accident was at that time the first accident that was directly filmed and , yes , with lethal consequence . </seg>
<seg id="58"> Apart from the titanic , the event at that time when an icon , a product went down and then never flew again afterwards . </seg>
<seg id="59"> The other machines were stopped , too . </seg>
<seg id="60"> And in nineteen thirty-nine , in nineteen forty the last still existing zeppelins were destroyed . </seg>
<seg id="61"> The material was used to build aircrafts for the war , the halls were dismantled . </seg>
<seg id="62"> Then there was nothing for about sixty years . </seg>
<seg id="63"> And then the shareholder ZF Friedrichshafen and Zeppelin had the idea , maybe we should relaunch . </seg>
<seg id="64"> And I was hired in two thousand five because although one wanted to develop a technically great product , we will come to that in a minute , but the market . </seg>
<seg id="65"> Well , is it a real market ? </seg>
<seg id="66"> And what is happening ? </seg>
<seg id="67"> Well . </seg>
<seg id="68"> We will talk about this now . </seg>
<seg id="69"> The Earl Zeppelin , I briefly have to explain this , yeah it is okay with the time , isn't it , achieved a lot . </seg>
<seg id="70"> There are a lot of companies that developed from this group . </seg>
<seg id="71"> Today , it is eighty thousand employees , a volume of about twenty billions . </seg>
<seg id="72"> That is a real economic power , highly profitable . </seg>
<seg id="73"> There is a lot behind it . </seg>
<seg id="74"> And then they convinced me to come over here . </seg>
<seg id="75"> The Zeppelin itself is actually a pretty normal aircraft , just like any other aircraft but , excuse me , has a gas inside of it , helium not hydrogen , and in it also a gas management with gas bags . </seg>
<seg id="76"> It is like a whale that goes up and down in the water and that has to equalize the pressure . </seg>
<seg id="77"> We don't have the time now to go more into detail. </seg>
<seg id="78"> This is the inside of a Zeppelin , with a structure . </seg>
<seg id="79"> There are two kinds of airships . </seg>
<seg id="80"> There are rigid airships , that's what we are , friction rigid in this case and non-rigid airships . </seg>
<seg id="81"> They have no structure inside and they are like balloons in the form of a cigarette . </seg>
<seg id="82"> They make up for most of the airships that were built all over the world , about four , five hundred . </seg>
<seg id="83"> And today there are only twenty-three left of them as a stock minus our own stock , so only about twenty . </seg>
<seg id="84"> This is how the production looks like , when an envelope is fit . </seg>
<seg id="85"> On the left side , once again the structure . </seg>
<seg id="86"> And the envelope is also highly technological . </seg>
<seg id="87"> It derives from the aerospace technology . </seg>
<seg id="88"> Origin : the space suits of the astronauts . </seg>
<seg id="89"> The landing on the moon at that time is the origin . </seg>
<seg id="90"> An envelope costs one point two million Euros . </seg>
<seg id="91"> And it has to be gas-tight and tear-proof and has to block UV light , because over and over you have to check that even if there was a rupture or a hole , that is would not become bigger . </seg>
<seg id="92"> This is where the employees work very detailed and check if there are any holes . </seg>
<seg id="93"> And in the end , an aircraft without its attachment looks like this . </seg>
<seg id="94"> Thus , the zeppelin is from a technical point of view a highly developed product . </seg>
<seg id="95"> And his we can see from the figures here , just shortly . </seg>
<seg id="96"> One point nine per cent , one point nine per cent , one point six four percent failure rate , this means that from thousand flights over the year about sixteen fail . </seg>
<seg id="97"> This is really not much and really , really good . </seg>
<seg id="98"> This is an industrial market . </seg>
<seg id="99"> It's nothing to sneeze at . </seg>
<seg id="100"> But there is another trend we are worried about at the moment and I depicted it to you up here . </seg>
<seg id="101"> Three years ago , we had to cancel or change forty-three percent of the flights because of the weather , when I had started in two thousand five , eight years ago , thirty-five per cent , and last year forty-seven per cent . </seg>
<seg id="102"> And this year in May we were at sixty per cent . </seg>
<seg id="103"> When you take the eight years , my eight years , at Zeppelin and try to do climate research , you can at least say that during these eight years , a very short period of course in climate research , in these eight year the weather conditions have significantly changed for us . </seg>
<seg id="104"> We are at the mercy of the wind . </seg>
<seg id="105"> We can neither fly our passengers through fog . </seg>
<seg id="106"> They want to see something . </seg>
<seg id="107"> And every year we actually have to cancel or change more flights . </seg>
<seg id="108"> The idea that we don't only have the feeling that the weather changes , but that it also changes statistically , because we make weather every day . </seg>
<seg id="109"> But because of this reason and this is something positive now , the EU started a program to do climate research , almost ten million Euros and we are a major part of this program . </seg>
<seg id="110"> I just came here from Finland this morning . </seg>
<seg id="111"> The airship is equipped here , it became a flying laboratory . </seg>
<seg id="112"> The campaign is named Pegasos . </seg>
<seg id="113"> And we analyze the air of the boundary layer between the earth's surface and two thousand meters . </seg>
<seg id="114"> It is called planetary boundary layer . </seg>
<seg id="115"> And the Zeppelin T flies from Italy up to Finland in a program that lasts altogether seven months . </seg>
<seg id="116"> For many hundred hours of flight it measures and analyses the air , how it reacts to our things that we are doing down there on earth . </seg>
<seg id="117"> There , as I have already explained , at the moment , we are up there with our second airship . </seg>
<seg id="118"> A great mission . </seg>
<seg id="119"> And it derives , if you want to see it like that , directly from the topic weather . </seg>
<seg id="120"> So it works really well . </seg>
<seg id="121"> These here are some further impressions . </seg>
<seg id="122"> The airship over Sweden last week or the week before . </seg>
<seg id="123"> And in Finland the weather is great , isn't it , twenty-five degrees , thirty degrees . </seg>
<seg id="124"> The people in Finland say that they have never had this before . </seg>
<seg id="125"> I just had some beautiful and pretty warm days over there . </seg>
<seg id="126"> Like that the mosquitoes weren't finally that bad . </seg>
<seg id="127"> We also have been to Africa . </seg>
<seg id="128"> And we had a special mission from De Beers to look for diamonds , I better have to say that we looked for subterranean volcanoes that have been ablated due to erosion for millions of years . </seg>
<seg id="129"> And now you can also ask yourself , all this is Africa , does it make sense that at the same time the film bloody or Blood Diamonds% is at the cinemas ? </seg>
<seg id="130"> I asked myself , what are we doing here ? </seg>
<seg id="131"> And what are we supporting here ? </seg>
<seg id="132"> In the end , we were finished after two years . </seg>
<seg id="133"> And the ode didn't continue . </seg>
<seg id="134"> The whole world crisis came in two thousand eight and the project was thus finished . </seg>
<seg id="135"> And a tornado damaged the mast of the Zeppelin that badly that it could directly stay down on earth . </seg>
<seg id="136"> But that wasn't that bad . </seg>
<seg id="137"> We had a quite good insurance and we were actually kind of glad . </seg>
<seg id="138"> Admittedly , this was the prototype. </seg>
<seg id="139"> And I didn't know what to do with it . </seg>
<seg id="140"> Yes , what we do today , a short abstract of business economics . </seg>
<seg id="141"> What we do today , it's about complexity , it's about questions , growth and continuance . </seg>
<seg id="142"> What we do today is the airship plant here in Friedrichshafen . </seg>
<seg id="143"> We do maintenance of course . </seg>
<seg id="144"> We always have to preserve the Zeppelin . </seg>
<seg id="145"> Obsolescence means aging . </seg>
<seg id="146"> There are devices inside of it that have to be replaced after ten , fifteen years again . </seg>
<seg id="147"> At the moment we are replacing the whole avionic system for almost five million Euros . </seg>
<seg id="148"> There, with the client Goodyear , we will talk about that . </seg>
<seg id="149"> We always have to do the basic development . </seg>
<seg id="150"> We are an aeronautically approved plant that is controlled by the German Aerospace Center and the European supervision , always and continuously , with inspections such as Lufthansa or also Airbus . </seg>
<seg id="151"> This is laborious and expensive and has to be maintained . </seg>
<seg id="152"> The question is : do we continue ? </seg>
<seg id="153"> Do we want to continue developing ? </seg>
<seg id="154"> Do we build bigger airships ? </seg>
<seg id="155"> There are cargo airships , pilotless airships . </seg>
<seg id="156"> What are we doing there ? </seg>
<seg id="157"> Do we go further in the market ? </seg>
<seg id="158"> Do we go further in the plants ? </seg>
<seg id="159"> And we certainly also tried this during my time . </seg>
<seg id="160"> And we also suffered defeats . </seg>
<seg id="161"> As well as the Earl Zeppelin suffered defeats and broke many times . </seg>
<seg id="162"> At the beginning , the donations from nineteen eight were written on the charts . </seg>
<seg id="163"> The German population saved him at that time with a donation of six million gold mark when the forth airship had an accident and he was broke , the population donated for him . </seg>
<seg id="164"> And from that the zeppelin company airship Zeppelin and the other companies derived , otherwise I wouldn't be here today and the other companies wouldn't be here either . </seg>
<seg id="165"> We were in Tokyo , dream city . </seg>
<seg id="166"> We were , you hear past tense , in San Francisco with a client . </seg>
<seg id="167"> There is a very potent investor behind it . </seg>
<seg id="168"> Unfortunately , both projects failed . </seg>
<seg id="169"> So also defeats . </seg>
<seg id="170"> At the same time we won Goodyear . </seg>
<seg id="171"> I have no picture for that since we are not allowed to show the Goodyear emblem yet . </seg>
<seg id="172"> But mainly in America the construction of the first Goodyear airship is almost finished . </seg>
<seg id="173"> We sold three . </seg>
<seg id="174"> Together with Goodyear , and a partner , we develop a new technology . </seg>
<seg id="175"> And this is a great success , but a defeat at the same time . </seg>
<seg id="176"> Two clients were liquidated because it hadn't worked any more . </seg>
<seg id="177"> Why didn't it work ? </seg>
<seg id="178"> We actually know the reason . </seg>
<seg id="179"> Either the location wasn't the right one or it was too far away for the passengers or in America they knew the non-rigid airships with commercials for the last thirty forty years . </seg>
<seg id="180"> The people looked up , saw the airship , and said : nice , another one , another non-rigid airship doing advertisement . </seg>
<seg id="181"> They didn't know that they can fly with it . </seg>
<seg id="182"> And it was even harder for the marketing to show this : hey , call us for a flight . </seg>
<seg id="183"> The lake Constance works well . </seg>
<seg id="184"> The pilots transport , welcome twelve thousand , thirteen thousand passengers a year . </seg>
<seg id="185"> But last year , we only had eleven thousand because of the weather . </seg>
<seg id="186"> Thus , half a million is directly missing . </seg>
<seg id="187"> This is bad . </seg>
<seg id="188"> The Zeppelin flies sixteen routes here . </seg>
<seg id="189"> It is the sense , that is of course pretty , when I , as a chief , see the passengers get out and everybody laughs and when we do not actually do advertisement because it is passed on from person to person and we always sell about thirteen thousand coupons and the people say , that is so nice , and recommend it to their friends and acquaintances and to whoever in their family . </seg>
<seg id="190"> And we are well booked . </seg>
<seg id="191"> Whereby I have to clear up the misunderstanding that we are booked out . </seg>
<seg id="192"> We can always fly more . </seg>
<seg id="193"> We have kind of a Nimbus at the Lake Constance and we would be booked out . </seg>
<seg id="194"> That is actually not true . </seg>
<seg id="195"> We also do advertisement . </seg>
<seg id="196"> This was once an art project sponsored by Audi . </seg>
<seg id="197"> And Audi did it together with the island Mainau . </seg>
<seg id="198"> But the advertising market is a difficult market . </seg>
<seg id="199"> And sometimes you have to ask : is it always reasonable to do advertisement ? </seg>
<seg id="200"> We do actually have enough advertisement , but the Internet has changed a lot , the flying ban form the start on because the big sponsors control everything . </seg>
<seg id="201"> The advertising market has almost broken away , therefore we only have ten active airships in the world today left . </seg>
<seg id="202"> We have three of them here . </seg>
<seg id="203"> Two actives ones , one wrapped up , the America airship , three were bought by Goodyear , the are active . </seg>
<seg id="204"> So six out of ten . </seg>
<seg id="205"> This means that we will actually control the market , if it is one . </seg>
<seg id="206"> And hope that we can derive a future from this . </seg>
<seg id="207"> And what at the end David Scott , commandant of Apollo fifteen , after a flight with a Zeppelin in Paris in two thousand five , he said : just the walk on the moon was nicer . </seg>
<seg id="208"> So it is great to fly with a zeppelin . </seg>
<seg id="209"> We also like advertising . </seg>
<seg id="210"> But we don't find any clients . </seg>
<seg id="211"> We like special missions , it has a technological value . </seg>
<seg id="212"> There we have clients . </seg>
<seg id="213"> It is not consistent . </seg>
<seg id="214"> It is amorphous , goes up and down . </seg>
<seg id="215"> You need several years to get a mission from the government . </seg>
<seg id="216"> And then there are non for some years . </seg>
<seg id="217"> There are also weird effects that are difficult to control . </seg>
<seg id="218"> In any case , there is this situation , airships , an aspect in the world market , actually no market . </seg>
<seg id="219"> We continue nevertheless . </seg>
<seg id="220"> It is an icon of the region . </seg>
<seg id="221"> The shareholders have the power to do it . </seg>
<seg id="222"> They are just wondering at the moment : in which way do we continue ? </seg>
<seg id="223"> How many money do we want to spend in the world market ? </seg>
<seg id="224"> What do we do for the region here ? </seg>
<seg id="225"> In which way do we want to run this ? </seg>
<seg id="226"> And me personally , you asked me to say something personal , I am apart from my background Dornier , when I wanted to save Dornier , at that time there were a lot of resistance , EADS also wanted to trample to death the little Dornier , it's about saving here , too . </seg>
<seg id="227"> Once I have been at Greenpeace for three years , financial ship , when I drove through Vancouver Island and I saw all the destroyed jungle , I was so angry that I asked for a job there . </seg>
<seg id="228"> And at that time , there was a succession of articles in the Spiegel about Greenpeace who were swamped with money and didn't know what to do with it and almost perished of it . </seg>
<seg id="229"> Then they hired me to restructure the whole thing . </seg>
<seg id="230"> And I was the chief financial officer of Greenpeace for three years and now I am doing this here hoping to have a great future with Zeppelin . </seg>
<seg id="231"> Zero , is it correct , forty seconds , I've nevertheless finished , thank you . </seg>
<seg id="232"> Applause </seg>
